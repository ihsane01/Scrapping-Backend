        "Abstract": "Blockchain has been relevant in the document management process, serving as a storage solution with the potential to guarantee the relevant requirements needed for any document storage and validation solution. However, due to the distributed nature of blockchain, we may face implementation difficulties and high operational costs, for example. To facilitate this process, we propose a customizable blockchain-based document registration service that makes it possible to create different types of gen-eralized documents for various application domains and store them in one or more blockchains integrated in an Application Programming Interface (API).",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global industry and create a trusted relationship in a multi-party business network. There are a number of practical use cases where blockchain has been applied. One specific area is the Art industry, where it is a natural fit in the way that art forensics and transactions are conducted, tracked and recorded. This motivates us to develop the ArtChain platform to assist the Art Industry. In this paper, we present ArtChain, which is an integrated trading system based on blockchain. It includes the front end, the back end, the services, the smart contract, the chain connection and the deployment scripts from the bottom to the top. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployed blockchain-enabled art trading platform in Australia. It provides a transparent yet privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof transaction history for registration, provenance, and traceability of art assets. Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical. For the interest of other researchers, our system implementation related resources are open-sourced on Github.",

This leads to high operating cost when deploying these relays between Ethereum-based blockchains where validating block headers on-chain is computationally expensive.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel relay scheme that employs a validation-on-demand pattern combined with economic incentives to reduce the cost of operating a relay between Ethereum-based blockchains by up to 92%. With this relay scheme, decentralized interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic becomes feasible.",

However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.",

The virtual power plant is an important branch of the energy internet, and it plays an important role in the aggregation of distributed power generation resources and the establishment of virtual power resource transactions. However, in the existing virtual power plant model, the following problems are becoming increasingly prominent, such as safeguard, credit rating system, privacy protection, benefit distribution. Firstly, the operation and transaction mechanism of the virtual power plant was introduced. Then, the blockchain technology is introduced into the virtual power plant transaction to make it more conducive to the information transparent, stable dispatch system, data security, and storage security. Finally, the operation and transaction system based on blockchain technology for the virtual power plant was design.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, leading research communities have been investigating the use of blockchains for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, where multiple participants, or agents, collaborate to make consensus decisions. To achieve this, the data in the blockchain storage have to be transformed into blockchain knowledge. We refer to these types of blockchains as knowledge-based blockchains. Knowledge-based blockchains are potentially useful in building efficient risk assessment applications. An earlier work introduced probabilistic blockchain which facilitates knowledge-based blockchains. This paper proposes an extension for the probabilistic blockchain concept. The design of a reputation management framework, suitable for such blockchains, is proposed. The framework has been developed to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications. In particular, we apply it to the detection of malicious nodes and reduce their effect on the probabilistic blockchains' consensus process. We evaluate the framework by comparing it to a baseline using several adversarial strategies. Further, we analyze the collaborative decisions with and without the malicious node detection. Both results show a sustainable performance, where the proposed work outperforms others and achieves excellent results.",

        "Abstract": "Today's blockchain landscape is severely fragmented as more and more heterogeneous blockchain platforms have been developed in recent years. These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

However, there may be unauthorized access while sharing data, which makes many entities unwilling to share their data to prevent data leakage. Based on blockchain and ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control) technology, this paper proposes an access control scheme, so that users can achieve fine-grained access control of their data when sharing them. The solution uses smart contract to achieve automated and reliable policy evaluation. IPFS (Interplanetary File System) is used for off-chain distributed storage to share the storage pressure of blockchain and guarantee the reliable storage of data. At the same time, all processes in the system are stored in the blockchain, ensuring the accountability of the system. Finally, the experiment proves the feasibility of the proposed scheme.",

Built-in LCD displays on each machine visualize current state of their local blockchains which allows easy visual observation of the consensus in the network. As machines are running fully capable Bitcoin Core clients, as well as mining clients for production of new blocks in the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocol, it is possible to investigate different configuration scenarios and when these lead to the break of the consensus.",

        "Abstract": "Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of today's world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product life-cycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.",

        "Abstract": "The characteristics of electric power engineering projects, such as multiple types, multiple links, multiple related parties, and decentralized construction have formed complex contracts and employment relationships. Numerous stakeholders make the owner's ability to control all parties involved in the project very limited, and the problems of information islands still exist. Firstly, electric power engineering project management problems, such as qualifications of contractors or subcontractors, subcontracting in breach of contract, lack of transparency in the payment of workers' wages, arrears of wages, withholding and embezzlement of contract funds, and malicious debt collection, were analysed. Then, the data deposit, enterprise and personnel credit management, contract management, project progress management, and funds management based on the blockchain technology were studied. Finally, the blockchian based electric power engineering project management system was designed.",

Blockchain-based self-emerging data infrastructures consist of a group of blockchain accounts that jointly take charge of protecting and transferring the data at the release time. Existing solutions have focused on fully rational adversarial environments in which all peer accounts are rational. However, such protection disregards scenarios in which malicious peer accounts also exist. In our work, we focus on protecting blockchain-based timed-release service in mixed adversarial environments in which both rational peer accounts and malicious peer accounts exist. We introduce our blockchain-based timed-release framework designed for mixed adversarial environments and illustrate two concrete attacks, namely drop attack and release-ahead attack, and discuss our reputation-based solution.",

        "Abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

Despite having valuable properties like decentralisation, and immutability of transactions, it incurs a high performance overhead as compared with traditional databases thus discouraging its further adoption. Even the usage of different transaction processors within the same Blockchain platform, namely Hyperledger Sawtooth, may result in different performance, for the same use case and the same transaction type. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the performance of two different transaction processors deployed in the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. We evaluated experimentally the methodology and present the results of the experimental evaluation which may be useful to blockchain practitioners for future solution designs.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.",

The solution consists of data sharing model and data sharing protocol. Firstly, using the distributed storage, decentralized management and non-tampering characteristics of the blockchain, we designed a data security sharing model. The model sets access control strategies on the blockchain platform, and uses the blockchain platform and distributed databases to store encrypted data together to prevent sensitive data from being tampered with and leaked. The data sharing protocol uses identity-based proxy re-encryption technology and distributed key generation technology. The protocol selects proxy nodes by the proof-of-stake algorithm, and realizes data sharing among users by re-encrypting sensitive data. The analysis of the solution discusses the correctness and security of the proposed scheme in terms of key generation.",

        "Title": "Evaluating the Impact of Network Latency on the Safety of Blockchain Transactions",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain came to prominence as the distributed ledger underneath Bitcoin, which protects the transaction histories in a fully-connected, peer-to-peer network. For safety against double-spending, a bitcoin transaction is only considered to be unrevokable after it is within a chain of at least six mined blocks on the blockchain-termed \"six confirmations\" for short. Besides the use for securing financial activity, blockchain technology is now also merged with various emerging applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). However, such emerging applications may have comparatively low Internet connectivity due to incorporating mobile devices, that may range away from network infrastructure. This paper investigates the impact of network latency on blockchain forking behavior and possible violations of the aforementioned six confirmations convention for transaction approval. To speed up our simulations, we simplify the lockchain's data structure, and avoid the extensive computation required in proof-of-work (PoW). Through simulation, we show that the six confirmations convention is sensitive to the peer-to-peer network latency, and also show how quickly it is violated with an easier difficulty of PoW mining. Unsurprisingly, the speed at which all nodes on the blockchain converge is shown to be severely affected by the latency of the underlying peer-to-peer network. It is also shown the extent to which nodes with more frequent Internet connectivity can gain an unfair advantage in terms of proof-ofwork mining rewards. We thus recommend that networks with heterogeneous latency profiles across nodes monitor fairness, and potentially preclude some nodes from being miners.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative development in open-source software (OSS) has long been limited by the lack of participation, i.e., A project is often maintained by an insufficient number of developers, especially for small- and medium-size projects. To establish a sustainable ecosystem for global developers and projects, we propose a decentralised and trustless open-source protocol Committable for all OSS software. The key insight behind Committable is an accountable and trusted tokenisation technology on blockchain that creates the CMT software assets for a variety of artefacts (e.g., document, code, testcase, makefile etc..) across the whole development lifecycle. A CMT token defines an abstraction of commits to OSS and systematically models the contribution from developers, therefore is far more comprehensive than a commit hash that are commonly used to identify software versions. In further, Committable introduces the Problem-Solution-Risk (PSR) framework to evaluate and reward a given set of CMT in an unbiased manner based on their contributions to a project. Owners of CMT are allowed to trade their tokens in the marketplace on blockchain established by Committable. The trading of CMT leads to transfer of token rights (e.g., sell, earn PSR rewards etc.), and more importantly, royalty to the developer for his or her original contribution. This demonstration proposal will introduce Committable on the test net of Ethereum and describe a preliminary case study with the OpenZeppelin project.",

Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology or a software component, requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of their technical principles and characteristics. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of blockchains usage and understanding their performance. Towards that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework which aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols, focusing on different aspects such as security and scalability. A set of modules is introduced for testing and evaluating the behaviour of blockchain protocols under different test scenarios.",

The traditional blockchain ensures the reliability of all data by making it public, thus reaching consensus and maintaining the consistency of the global state. This means that everyone's transaction data is phanic to the outside world, resulting in a massive breach of users' personal privacy. Since this reason, we propose a new kind of blockchain privacy protection scheme, which applies the trusted execution environment in the blockchain, designs an encrypted communication and authentication scheme, and realizes the function of providing privacy protection for the blockchain. And most of the computations are moved out of the chain, which greatly reduces the delay and burden of on-chain computations. Experiments show that this architecture has good confidentiality and usability.",

        "Title": "A Hybrid Blockchain Architecture for Privacy-Enabled and Accountable Auctions",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based aucti...",

In this paper, we propose a clustering strategy on node community clustering by constructing a trust model based on the decentralization of blockchain technology. We introduce a multi-chain storage structure. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces data synchronization time and storage space, improves system performance by enabling efficient parallel processing.",

The most appealing aspect of cryptocurrencies that garnered significant attention is its potential to enable (pseudo) anonymous transactions on the blockchain ledger. Unsurprisingly, this has led to rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies for unlawful activities by malicious actors in several ways. Hence, to detect these unlawful activities, it is essential to analyze the blockchain ledgers to derive insights by investigating anonymous transactions and activities, which is where blockchain forensics comes in. In this paper, we present a taxonomy mapping the identified high-level forensics features with the supporting forensics tools that we surveyed. We provide a comparison of the surveyed tools using three practical parameters (number of cryptocurrencies supported, number of features provided and ease of accessing services) and give an overview of their theoretical effectiveness in general with some open challenges identified.",

To safe-guard security and privacy of EHR, access control is an essential mechanism for managing EHR data. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture to facilitate access control of EHR data by using both blockchain and edge node. Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.",

        "Abstract": "A neural key exchange is a secret key exchange technique based on neural synchronization of the neural network. Since the neural key exchange is based on synchronizing weights within the neural network structure, the security of the algorithm does not depend on the attacker's computational capabilities. However, due to the neural key exchange's repetitive mutual-learning processes, using explicit user authentication methods -such as a public key certificate- is inefficient due to high communication overhead. Implicit authentication based on information that only authorized users know can significantly reduce overhead in communications. However, there was a lack of realistic methods to distribute secret information for authentication among authorized users. In this paper, we propose the concept idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, we present a method to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain.",

However, user privacy protection's performance and data capacity have not been well studied in existing access control models of blockchain systems because of traceability and openness of the P2P network. This paper focuses on investigating performance and data capacity from a blockchain infrastructure perspective, which adds secondary encryption to shield confidential information in a non-invasive way. First, we propose an efficient asymmetric encryption scheme by combining homomorphic encryption and state-of-the-art multi-signature key aggregation to preserve privacy. Second, we use smart contracts and CA infrastructure to achieve attribute-based access control. Then, we use the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof scheme to achieve secondary confidentiality explicitly. Finally, experiments show our scheme succeeds better performance in data capacity and system than other schemes. This scheme improves availability and robust scalability, solves the problem of multi-signature key distribution and the unlinkability of transactions. Our scheme has established a sound security cross-chain system and privacy confidentiality mechanism and that has more excellent performance and higher system computing ability than other schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are poised to revolutionize the modern economy by democratizing commerce. These currencies operate on top of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer unparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency. However, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread adoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep them from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network. Permissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but they are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies due to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several multi-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and permissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with decentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in literature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different types of consensus to manage each layer. However, many such works come with the assumptions of honest majority which may not accurately reflect the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the \u201clayered\u201d approach taken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to analyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic analysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system parameters required for a distributed ledger\u2019s secure operation in a more realistic setting.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional blockchain implementations with append-only semantics do not support deleting or overwriting data in confirmed blocks. However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. Existing attempts to reconcile these contradictions compromise on core qualities of the blockchain paradigm, as they include backdoor-like approaches such as central authorities with elevated rights or usage of specialized chameleon hash algorithms in chaining of the blocks. The contribution of this paper is a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A context chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and persons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contexts. We show how this architecture supports truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, how the GDPR regulations can be fulfilled by this architecture and how it differs from sidechains and state channels.",

        "Title": "Scalable Privacy-Preserving Query Processing over Ethereum Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technologies have recently received considerable attention, partly due to the success of cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.",

        "Abstract": "The main advantage of the Bitcoin-style blockchain systems is immutability of data and decentralized authority. Despite its success, Bitcoin suffers from scalability issues. The potential of the blockchain technology cannot be fully realized unless it is made more scalable. We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain. FastChain improves the throughput by 20%~40% in the normal operations.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has been treated as one of the most promising technologies to promote crowdsourcing by providing new nice features, such as decentralization and accountability. Unfortunately, some inherent limitations of blockchain have been rarely addressed by the most existing works when applying blockchain into crowdsourcing, which becomes the performance bottleneck of crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform to achieve decentralization and privacy preservation. Our platform integrates with a hybrid blockchain structure, dual-ledgers, and dual consensus algorithms to ensure secure communication between the requesters and the workers. Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively. Finally, we conduct experiments to confirm the efficiency of the adopted consensus algorithm on our platform by comparing it with the state-of-the-art.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, electronic medical records(EMR) have became a new type of digital medical service instead of handwritten paper medical records. However, due to different medical institutions belong to different trustworthy domains, there exites barriers to health data exchang, interoperability, and so on. Considering that it was difficult to share medical record data among different medical institutions, we propose an blockchain based EMR data sharing scheme with searchable and verifiable encryption, i.e. SV-DEMR. In SV-DEMR, we propose a hybrid chain which includes consortium chain and private chain. To acheive the secure storage and sharing of EMR, we use the medical institution server to store the EMR ciphertext, the private chain to store the ciphertext hash value, and the consortium chain to share the ciphertext and key parameters. Moreover, we also propose a CP-ABE algorithm that ciphertext searchable and identity verifiable to realize access control and guarantee authenticity of data and efficient index of ciphertext on the blockchain, named SV-CPABE. Finally, the security of our SV-DEMR is proved theoretically. The extensive experiments are made to demonstrate the better performance in SV-DEMR.",

With the access of a large number of heterogeneous edge devices and the in-depth development of edge computing technology in various fields, it has brought huge challenges to the security management and data privacy protection in the edge computing architecture. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight edge computing data privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain and homomorphic encryption. Above all, set edge computing servers as distributed nodes of the blockchain network and utilize the decentralization of blockchain and the non-tamperable characteristics of information to ensure the distributed storage of data and information recording. Then, designing a blockchain data encryption transmission scheme based on homomorphic encryption which could guarantee data transmission between edge nodes in the form of homomorphic ciphertext. Meanwhile, supporting the verification of the legality and correctness of the transaction in the form of ciphertext. Simulation experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can carry out effective data encryption transmission and has certain application potential.",

        "Abstract": "We present a blockchain based system that allows data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to collaboratively train machine learning models in a trustless AI marketplace. Data is a highly valued digital asset and central to deriving business insights. Our system enables data owners to retain ownership and privacy of their data, while still allowing AI developers to leverage the data for training. Similarly, AI developers can utilize compute resources from cloud vendors without loosing ownership or privacy of their trained models. Our system protocols are set up to incentivize all three entities - data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to truthfully record their actions on the distributed ledger, so that the blockchain system provides verifiable evidence of wrongdoing and dispute resolution. Our system is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric and can provide a viable alternative to centralized AI systems that do not guarantee data or model privacy. We present experimental performance results that demonstrate the latency and throughput of its transactions under different network configurations where peers on the blockchain may be spread across different datacenters and geographies. Our results indicate that the proposed solution scales well to large number of data and model owners and can train up to 70 models per second on a 12-peer non optimized blockchain network and roughly 30 models per second in a 24 peer network.",

In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system.",

        "Abstract": "Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection services. While service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services is decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to distributed IoT based SPS system.",

        "Abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has many technical characteristics such as distributed, traceable, trustless, difficult to tamper with, and multi-centralized. Blockchain can effectively establish a financial asset management system based on digital technology, automatically docking assets of different industrial forms into a digital financial framework. It can realize the automatic mapping and circulation of assets under the chain, and create an economic network integrating financial asset digitization and asset management. Blockchain technology has attracted much attention, but in its development process, there are still problems such as inconsistent standards, chaotic derivative markets, threats to security, and difficulty in supervision, so that the current blockchain and physical business docking products that can be implemented in the market less. This paper analyzes the application cases of digital financial asset transactions based on blockchain technology, studies the current pain points of blockchain technology in various digital financial asset transaction industries, and provides corresponding solutions.",

We make traceability of assets in the permissioned blockchain be defined and be expressed as a hidden Markov model. There exists no dishonest increase and decrease of assets in this model. The condition is called balance. As we encrypt this model with fully homomorphic encryption and apply the zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge, we show that the trace-ability and balance of the permissioned blockchain are able to be proved in zero knowledge to the permissionless blockchain with concealing the asset allocation of the permissioned blockchain.",

In particular, the context of medicine exercise poses as a crucial one, since the professionals involved in this field are responsible for dealing with the health of third parties. However, we may notice a number of incidents and frauds related to the professionals records of physicians, such as issuing forged diplomas or availability of information not validated. In order to avoid these frauds, one can highlight the relevance of investigating innovative solutions aiming to maintain in a safe and transparent way the professional history of each doctor. In this context, our objective and major contribution is to present MIRIAM, a blockchain-based web application based on the Hyperledger platform, that allows, in a decentralized and reliable fashion, the storage of relevant information necessary for managing registrations of medical professionals. In addition, we explored the Brazilian regulatory framework to clarify the solution's feasibility in a real-world workflow scenario.",

        "Abstract": "IoT devices have the characteristics of limited performance and mobility, which makes it difficult for traditional centralized security authentication methods to support security authentication in the current IoT environment. In order to cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a security authentication system named iot-chain in the Internet of Things, which provides attribute-based security authentication based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. The system contains three kinds of chain codes, namely access code, device code, and policy code. The access code is the main program that implements the user safety authentication method. The device code provides a query method for the URL of the resource data generated by the storage device, and the policy code provides the access control strategy for the administrator user. Combining access control and blockchain technology, iot-chain provides dynamic security authentication management in the Internet of Things. Experimental results show that iot-chain can maintain high throughput and effectively reach consensus in a distributed system.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

        "Abstract": "Publish/subscribe is a communication paradigm used in distributed applications to easily exchange messages. This paradigm usually has a centralized architecture where a broker is responsible for transferring all the messages, hence can be a source of trust issues. In a threat model where the broker can be malicious, two honest entities cannot be sure of the origin of a message. There exist propositions for distributed publish/subscribe protocols replacing the broker by a blockchain. Those propositions all have in common an extensive usage of the blockchain, which makes them expensive over time, due to blockchain fees, and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce SUPRA, a distributed publish/subscribe protocol. This protocol has the same security guarantees than other solutions relying on blockchains, but where the vast majority of messages are off-chain. The message exchanges are done mostly directly between publishers and subscribers and the blockchain is only used in case of network issues, if a message is lost, or an entity is suspected to be malicious.",

        "Abstract": "The revolutionary concept of blockchain, the technology behind the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors, has ushered in a new era in the Internet and online services. While most people focus only on cryptocurrencies when they think about Blockchain, in fact many administrative activities and day-to-day services are managed offline and/or privately are now being securely transferred to the Internet as online services. Electronic Voting is one of the trending and important aspect of online services. Traditional voting systems in our country include the use of ballots at polling stations or EVM's (Electronic Voting Machine). The ballot system is prone to tampering, whereas EVM's being a centralised system, are prone to hacking. We aim to offer a more secure, transparent, safer, cheaper and easier to use alternative to the above methods of voting, by making use of the revolutionary Blockchain technology. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of code that are incorporated into the Blockchain and implemented on schedule at each stage of the Blockchain update. Ethereum and its network is one of the most convenient due to its stability, wide usability and smart contract logic. In this work, we will be implementing and testing a prototype of an E-Voting application using Ethereum Wallet and Solidity language as a smart contract for the Ethereum network.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is seen as a promising technology to provide reliable and secure services due to its decentralized characteristic. However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

        "Abstract": "Although Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention, the inaccurate pricing of Bitcoin options has resulted in an inefficient crypto derivative market. In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",

Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

        "Abstract": "We evaluate and analyze the performance of a local electricity market for energy trading that we implemented on the Ethereum platform. The energy trading is based on a double auction with multiple sellers and multiple buyers; the matched price and volume are determined by a trade reduction mechanism. We benchmark the performance of Ethereum using a systematic blockchain performance evaluation method. Based on this, we propose and analyze an efficient market operation method. In particular, we relate the limits on the scalability and real-time performance of the market to the throughput and latency of the Ethereum platform. We also identify the minimum resources necessary to operate an Ethereum client.",

        "Abstract": "The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file system that seeks to decentralize the web and to make it faster and more efficient. It incorporates well-known technologies, including BitTorrent and Git, to create a swarm of computing systems that share information. Since its introduction in 2016, IPFS has seen great improvements and adoption from both individuals and enterprise organizations. Its distributed network allows users to share files and information across the globe. IPFS works well with large files that may consume or require large bandwidth to upload and/or download over the Internet. The rapid adoption of this distributed file system is in part because IPFS is designed to operate on top of different protocols, such as FTP and HTTP. However, there are underpinning concerns relating to security and access control, for example lack of traceability on how the files are accessed. The aim of this paper is to complement IPFS with blockchain technology, by proposing a new approach (BlockIPFS) to create a clear audit trail. BlockIPFS allows us to achieve improved trustworthiness of the data and authorship protection, and provide a clear route to trace back all activities associated with a given file using blockchain as a service.",

        "Abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

        "Abstract": "While the Bitcoin and Ethereum are still leading the world of permissionless blockchains, we are increasingly seeing a multipolar ecosystem where new blockchains keep emerging instead of migrating to the two big players. As a result, it is highly desired to enable multiple blockchains to interoperate, e.g., move assets from one blockchain to the other. The crosschain bridge service, as a solution to the blockchain interoperability problem, has been offered by a wide range of service providers. However, the existing bridges either rely on centralised notaries or require complicated preparations, therefore are far from sufficient in practice. In this demo proposal, we highlight the Poly Bridge for heterogeneous blockchains to interoperate with cryptocurrencies. In specific, Poly Bridge is based on an un-derlying Poly Chain and a pair of relays to confirm crosschain transactions and form consensus among relevant parties. More importantly, Poly Bridge delivers extensibility to flexibly inter-face to blockchains with different consensus models and atomicity as well in a way that a sequence of crosschain operations are either all confirmed or all rejected. Poly Bridge is now available as a web application to support crosschain requests with over 200 types of cryptocurrencies on 18 blockchains.",

This technology is raising a lot of interest both in academia and industry, but the lack of tools to evaluate design and implementation decisions may hamper fast progress. To address this issue, this paper presents a discrete-event simulator that is flexible enough to evaluate different blockchain implementations. These blockchains can be rapidly modeled and simulated by extending existing models. Running Bitcoin and Ethereum simulations allowed us to change conditions and answer different questions about their performance. For example, we concluded that doubling the number of transactions per block has a low impact on the block propagation delay (10ms) and that encrypting communication has a high impact in that delay (more than 25%).",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on the public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, multiple-shard contract calling, strict transaction atomicity, and shard availability, which are essential requirements but also challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving flexible multiple-shard contract calling. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. On a test-bed of 128 AliCloud servers, setting 32 shards and 4 consortium members, Meepo-OpenEtheruem can achieve more than 140,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions. It also shows more than 50,000 TPS under the transactions of real-world shopping behaviors.",

This study proposes implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm using blockchain-based smart contracts, as a testbed for evaluating the performance of blockchains in real-time control. We furthermore investigate sharding mechanisms as a means of improving the system's scalability with fixed computing resources. We implement our models as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain platform, the Matpower library in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and Hyperledger Caliper as our performance evaluation tool. We found that sharding does indeed lead to a substantial improvement in system scalability for this domain, measured by both transaction success rates and transaction latency.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain techniques are attracting growing interest due to their capability of immutable and anonymous recording without any centralized authority. One of the difficulties blockchain researchers are facing is a lack of ways to verify behaviors of large scale blockchain networks. In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.",

To clarify who is liable for the product, the fabricator should keep the fabrication history in an immutable and sustainably accessible manner. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, \"Fabchain,\" that can record the fabrication history in such a manner. By utilizing a scheme that employs a blockchain as an auditable communication channel, Fabchain manages print jobs for the fabricator\u2019s 3D printer over the blockchain, while maintaining a history of a print job. We implemented Fabchain on Ethereum and evaluated the performance for recording a print job. Our results demonstrate that Fabchain can complete communication of a print job sequence in less than 1 minute on the Ethereum test network. We conclude that Fabchain can manage a print job in a reasonable duration for 3D printing, while satisfying the requirements for immutability and sustainability.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains have attracted a great deal of attention as a technology for the distributed management of register information at multiple nodes without a centralized system. However, they possess the drawbacks of low transaction throughput and long approval time. These problems can be addressed by shortening the block generation interval; however, shortening this interval alone has the effect of increasing the frequency of forks. In this study, we aim to shorten the block generation interval without increasing the fork generation rate by improving the network topology of the nodes and shortening the propagation time. We propose a neighbor node selection method forming a network topology with a short block propagation time. A blockchain simulator is used to demonstrate the effect of the proposed neighbor node selection method on the propagation delay of the network. This result indicates that the proposed method improves block propagation time.",

        "Title": "Proof of Authenticity of Logistics Information with Passive RFID Tags and Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "When tracing large (robotically automated) logistics, passive RFID tags are preferred because of their low cost. Therefore, among the many challenges of RFID, security between such a tag and a reader was the main area of research. Yet, the authenticity of data cannot be assured if the service releases falsified information to users either intentionally or by accident. Applying blockchain in supply chains is often referred to and even tested, but it just writes records as instructed, and there is a risk of falsified records being written in the first place. Thus, we propose a design in which a tamper-evident, location-limited, and digitally signing reader writes digital evidence into a blockchain service in an atomic (indivisible) fashion, as they report that a tag is read or written. This allows integrity and confidentiality of the logistics information maintained throughout the system, even if the private keys or signature algorithms are compromised, or the public key certificates expire. To show that our proposal is feasible, we present a prototype design. As a result, the authenticity of logistics information using inexpensive passive tags can be assured. Moreover, this solution can also be applied to IoT (Internet of Things) in general.",

The attributes of music propagation environment are the participation degree of music propagation intelligent agent. The two kinds of intelligent agents realize music communication mainly according to the interactive rules of music information propagation. It is found in the study that the greater the value of music information, the more the number of music propagation agents are; the faster the speed of music information transmission among music propagation intelligent agents becomes, the greater the value of music information is and the more obviously the willingness of the propagation groups rises. In comparison with similar propagation models, the music communication model based on intelligent agent has faster transmission efficiency and higher application value.",

In this regard, this paper proposes an on-chain solution that allows for fine-grained modification (update and erasure) operations on transactions\u2019 (TX) data fields within a BC. The proposed solution is based on a cryptographic primitive called Chameleon Hashing. Via this approach, BC users have the authority to update their data, which are addressed at the TX level with no side effects on the block or chain. By performing and storing data updates, all on-chain traceability and verifiability characteristics of the BC are preserved.",

        "Title": "Meepo: Sharded Consortium Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, cross-contract flexibility, shard availability, and strict transaction atomicity, which are the essential requirements but also the challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving cross-contract flexibility. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. We implement Meepo on the AliCloud, using 32 shards in maximum, achieving more than 120,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions.",

        "Title": "A Certificateless Consortium Blockchain for IoTs",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is multi-centralized, immutable and traceable, thus is very suitable for distributed storage, privacy and security management in IoTs. However, most existing researches focus on the integration of public blockchain and IoTs. In fact, problems such as slow consensus, low transmission throughput, and completely open storage on the public blockchain are intolerable in IoT scenarios. Although consortium blockchain represented by Hyperledger Fabric has improved the transmission rate, its data security completely relies on the PKI-based certificate mechanism, resulting in transmission inefficiency and privacy leakage. In this paper, a key-derived Controllable Lightweight Secure Certificateless Signature (CLS 2 ) algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the transmission efficiency and keep similar computation overhead of consortium blockchain. Compared with the existing certificateless signatures, CLS 2 achieves more secure transactions, whose controllable anonymity and key-derived mechanism not only prevents public key replacement attacks and forged signature attacks, but also supports hierarchical privacy protection. Armed with CLS 2 , we design a consortium blockchain security architecture based on Hyper-ledger Fabric and edge computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of certificateless signature in consortium blockchain. We formally prove the security of our schemes in the random oracle model. Specifically, the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Security analysis and experiments in IoT scenarios verify the feasibility and effectiveness of CLS 2 .",

However, these solutions are either tailored to specific assets or neglect finality guarantees that prevent assets from getting lost in transit. In this paper, we present a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol that supports arbitrary assets and adheres to finality requirements. The ability to freely transfer assets between blockchains may increase transaction throughput and provide developers with more flexibility by allowing them to design digital assets that leverage the capacities and capabilities of multiple blockchains.",

There are some exciting blockchain features but among them, decentralization is undoubtedly the most interesting one. Organizations can share data within a distributed ledger. As a consequence, each one can access synchronized data stored in its local Blockchain node. This functionality improves transaction tracking and facilitates access to data within a private group of organizations. However, in some cases, even if organizations accept to share data, they require to hide some private information related to their users or their business model. To tackle privacy and trust issues between organizations, this paper presents a blockchain architecture based on the proxy re-encryption scheme. This scheme is integrated within smart contracts to provide a very efficient, fast, and secure platform. The proposed architecture is implemented in an Hyperledger Blockchain and tested in a real transport and mobility use case.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has positively impacted traceability across various industries such as logistics and shipping. By overcoming the problem of data silos among organizations and concentration of authority, this innovative approach allows a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger to be built. On the other hand, the use of non-fungible tokens, a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, is expected to be able to represent complicated operations in traceability systems. However, the existing token design lacks an efficient model for retrieval of past histories. The most popular way to retrieve past information on tokens is to use blockchain explorers, which are centralized trusted parties. Otherwise, so far there is only a naive way to examine all block headers, and it takes a vast amount of time. Our preliminary study shows that the processing time for retrieving all histories of 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet takes approximately 57 minutes. We propose a new token design based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that allows token histories to be efficiently explored without examining the whole blockchain. The model associates each state of the token from past to latest and covers expressions of relationships between tokens, such as merge and split. Our implementation and evaluation reveal that the DAG-based token design significantly improves the efficiency of exploring token transfer histories. The results show that our method can complete the exploration for 1,030 tokens in a matter of seconds and maintains performance over the long term even if the blockchain grows.",

Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.",

        "Abstract": "Diverse technologies, such as machine learning and big data, have been driving the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous proliferation of IoT devices. Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir\u2019s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB\u2019s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto\u2019s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.",

        "Abstract": "In many organizations, permissioned blockchain networks are currently transitioning from a proof-of-concept stage to production use. A crucial part of this transition is ensuring awareness of potential threats to network operations. Due to the plethora of software components involved in distributed ledgers, threats may be difficult or impossible to detect without a structured monitoring approach. To this end, we conduct a survey of attacks on permissioned blockchains and develop a set of threat indicators. To gather these indicators, a data processing pipeline is proposed to aggregate log information from relevant blockchain components, enriched with data from external sources. To evaluate the feasibility of monitoring current blockchain frameworks, we determine relevant data sources in Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that the required data is mostly available, but also highlight significant improvement potential with regard to threat intelligence, chaincode scanners and built-in metrics.",

        "Title": "Scalable Blockchain Anomaly Detection with Sketches",
        "Abstract": "The growing popularity of Blockchain networks attracts also malicious and hacking users. Effectively detecting inappropriate and malicious activity should thus be a top priority for safeguarding blockchain networks and services. Blockchain behavior analysis can be used to detect unusual account activities or time periods with network-wide irregular properties. Thus, optimized anomaly detection based on historical data is an essential task for securing transactions and services. However, processing the complete blockchain history can be slow and costly due to its large size and rapid growth. In this paper we suggest addressing this challenge by analyzing summarized blocks data structures, called sketches, rather than the entire blockchain. Sketches are common data structures used in computer systems and blockchain networks, to allow compact data representation while supporting efficient executions of particular queries. We study how sketches can be used to detect suspicious accounts or time periods without the need to maintain or go through the entire blockchain data. We design solutions for the major known attacks and conduct experiments to evaluate them based on real Ethereum data. We compare the accuracy, run-time and memory usage of our algorithms with traditional detection algorithms relying on the complete blockchain data. Our results indicate that sketch-based anomaly detection methods can provide a practical scalable solution for detecting anomalies in blockchain networks.",

To address these problems. We propose an accountable CP-ABE mechanism based on block chain system. First, we establish two authorization agencies MskCA and AttrVN(Attribute verify Network),where the MskCA can realize master key escrow, and the AttrVN manages and validates users' attributes. In this way, our system can avoid the single point of failure and improve the privacy of user attributes and security of keys. Moreover, in order to realize auditability of CP-ABE key parameter transfer, we introduce the did and record parameter transfer process on the block chain. Finally, we theoretically prove the security of our CP-ABE. Through comprehensive comparison, the superiority of CP-ABE is verified. At the same time, our proposed schemes have some properties such as fast decryption and so on.",

        "Title": "BLOCKEYE: Hunting for DeFi Attacks on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Decentralized finance, i.e., DeFi, has become the most popular type of application on many public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) in recent years. Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participantsfunds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before. A video of BLOCKEYE is available at https://youtu.be/7DjsWBLdlQU.",

With the booming development of blockchain in recent years, blockchain technology provides a new solution in the field of e-voting. Multi-District election is an important method of election in real life, e.g. in US presidential election. Inspired by the electoral college system, we propose a blockchain-based e-voting scheme for multi-district election. First, we propose a blockchain-based voter registration method that all voters are authenticated by the blockchain system. Second, we design a two-layer blockchain architecture, where the lower layer records the votes of voters in each district and the higher layer records the votes of electors. Then we describe the voting process and evaluate the security and availability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy the needs of multi-district election.",

        "Title": "Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Multi-Keyword Search over Encrypted Data on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated searchable blockchains that not only provide reliable search over encrypted distributed storage systems but ensure privacy is preserved. Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has attracted lots of attention in recent years. However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions. Experimental results show the efficiency that Aeolus can achieve more than 100 000 transactions/s of blockchain transactions, which is 15.6 times the throughput of the original blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has gained considerable traction over the last few years and plays a critical role in realizing decentralized and cryptocurrency applications. A challenge that has been over-looked in prior blockchain algorithms is that they do not consider large-scale network outages and relied on the assumption of a reliable global network connectivity. In the event of a large scale network partition, forks may occur between partitioned regions. After the partition ends they will be discarded, leading to the loss of many blocks and a considerable amount of wasted work. This paper presents PeloPartition, which provides a sharding mechanism to improve blockchain's resilience to the possibility of a global internet outage. In PeloPartition we form consensus groups dynamically and consider the partitioning of the group as a hint to split the blockchain into branches and guarantee that all of them will be merged after the network is recovered. We indicate different methodologies to ensure blockchain security while partitioning occurs. Our experiments use simulations to show how this approach can improve the performance of blockchain algorithms and prevent wasted computational power during partitioning.",

However, the existing decentralized blockchain-based solutions are complex and involve financial incentives, which limits their applications. We propose a secure permissioned blockchain-based decentralized system, VAULT, with a novel quorum-based consensus. We store encrypted files using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and the references to the files in the blockchain. VAULT is designed for applications involving collaboration from multiple permissioned parties, and users can store, access, and share data as well as manage projects through blockchain. Our experimental results show that our quorum selection is fair, and the VAULT protocol is scalable.",

        "Title": "Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Identity in the Era of Blockchain: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "With the emergence of concepts such as Metaverse and Web 3.0, digital identity plays a very important role as one of its infrastructures. The traditional digital identity model is no longer suitable for the requirements of the digital economy to some extent at this stage. The traditional centralized identity management system has many drawbacks. For example, the owner of the digital identity does not actually control his own identity, and there is a risk of easy disclosure and theft of identity information. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, traceability, etc., which can effectively solve the problems of centralized digital identity. After analyzing and summarizing the evolution trend of digital identity from centralization to decentralization, this paper focuses on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based on blockchain. Based on the analysis and comparison of various SSI implementation schemes, the development difficulties of blockchain digital identity are summarized and the future development direction is pointed out.",

        "Abstract": "We design a Multi-Layer Aggregate Verification (MLAV) solution to improve supply chain management with IoT Blockchain devices. We apply MLAV to IoT Blockchain applications in Agriculture 4.0 to demonstrate the feasibility of our solutions and models. In the current Agriculture 4.0 structure, large companies have successfully applied blockchain solutions and ecosystems for tracking and tracing agricultural produce, achieving transparency, traceability, and digitalization. However, these existing blockchain solutions are not comprehensive. First, the upstream nodes they serve are all large-scale production suppliers, and smallholders are not taken into consideration. In order to solve this problem, we use a multi-layer architecture that serves three purposes: facilitating smallholders in joining the agricultural blockchain as equal-opportunity nodes, uploading of production activity data, and reducing costs (ex. Ethereum gas fee). Second, the majority of IoT blockchains adopt an ID-based signature scheme in IoT devices, which frequently has lower efficiency. In applying aggregate verification, we may effectively increase ID-based verification efficiency while processing large clusters of data transferred by IoT devices. Finally, we design a blockchain management framework using smart contracts to facilitate the financing of upstream producers.",

The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and re-train them. We propose a framework for participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to host a continuously updated model. This model will be shared publicly on a blockchain where it can be free to use for inference. Ideal learning problems include scenarios where a model is used many times for similar input such as personal assistants, playing games, recommender systems, etc. In order to maintain the model's accuracy with respect to some test set we propose both financial and non-financial (gamified) incentive structures for providing good data.

After the completion of the ride, the drivers are rated by the riders. There are possibilities that, a malicious rider can claim the refund with a fake complain and give the driver poor rating. Current system is not capable of deciding the correctness of the objections raised by either parties and provides a biased outcome of each objections as per the centralized company's marketing strategies. We present BlockV, a blockchain enabled solution to ensure the fairness of the ride. The creation, completion, dissatisfaction or abortion of any ride will be written in the blockchain ledger, hence will be available to all participants in the peer to peer network. This simultaneously ensures the fairness in maintenance of the inbuilt reputation system.

Efforts are being made to reduce carbon footprint to mitigate such effects. Calculating the carbon footprint of food products is complex and requires the cooperation of all the stakeholders of the food supply chain. A record keeping system for tracking carbon footprint while preserving privacy for the related parties is needed. This paper presents a new implementation of blockchain for tracking of carbon footprint on food production and transportation stages. We designed a system that tracks the carbon footprint of food processing facilities and transportation parties using cluster-based record keeping while preserving their privacy. We implemented the proposed carbon footprint chain and evaluated its throughput and latency under different scenarios. We show that our blockchain implementation is capable of operating with a larger number of nodes without any scalability issues.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we add secure multiparty computation capabilities to the permissioned blockchain architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, and use them to implement the clearing price mechanism for initial public offering (IPO). As with any blockchain, the core property in Fabric is that all peers must see the same ledger, so using confidential data on the ledger is a challenge. To address this challenge we use cryptographic secure multiparty computation (MPC), which requires that we integrate a few new mechanisms into the Fabric architecture. Specifically we need to let the peers access local information such as their respective secret keys, and also send messages to each other while executing smart contracts. We also had to add to Fabric a library that implements the required cryptographic tools, and to make that library accessible from the smart contracts. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution by using it to implement the clearing price mechanism for IPOs. We designed an efficient cryptographic protocol for the IPO clearing price mechanism, and used our integrated system to run it on Fabric. Although not fully optimized yet, the performance of the resulting implementation is more than fast enough for this particular application, ranging from 8 to 23 seconds to execute an IPO sale.",

In order to analyze what other types of attacks could develop from the contamination of the blockchain, we constructed specific attack scenarios and analyzed the ease of such attacks by conducting demonstrations experiments.

Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be \u201cThe DAO Attack\u201d in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary\u2019s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.",

Using the already proven DevOps approach in this setting makes sense, as it can accelerate the general pace of software development and delivery, improve software quality, and increase overall productivity. However, there is currently a lack of guidance on a structured DevOps approach and a breakdown of the specifics in the context of blockchain-based software development. Therefore, we combined gray literature and DevOps application studies from pertinent GitHub projects to systematically investigate current practices and solution approaches for an efficient blockchain-oriented DevOps procedure. In this process, we elaborated procedural steps and related activities according to the main stages of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Our research shows that core DevOps concepts and activities are similar to other areas and are entirely possible with already established CI/CD solutions that orchestrate the right tools, with the difference that more rigorous testing and differentiated deployment practices are required due to the inherent immutability of blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains add blocks, and consequently the chain weight, randomly. The blocks added also have a significant network delay owing to their large size. Large delay combined with randomness causes forks that are responsible for many security problems. One can reduce fork occurrences by designing a system with large block intervals and size but this design compromises performance aspects such as confirmation time guarantees. The trade-off between security and performance in PoW blockchain is a well discussed topic in the literature. In this paper, we aim to reduce the conflict between security and performance through our novel concept of Links. Links are small, fast and frequent structures that can be incorporated on any new or existing PoW blockchains. Links help reduce the confirmation time of its underlying blockchain while preserving its consistency security guarantees. Our novel lower-bound growth rate for PoW systems with links in the presence of a general adversary in a partially synchronous network, shows that links provide a more steady chain growth rate than classic PoW systems without links. On a well-established, secure system like Bitcoin, we use the derived growth rate to show that when links are incorporated to Bitcoin, they help reduce its confirmation time from 60 minutes by half to 30 minutes, while retaining the consistency threshold guarantees of the original Bitcoin system. We provide a proof of concept emulation of links in a Bitcoin test bed consisting of 210 nodes having real world latencies between them. We benchmark a system with links against Bitcoin to show links cause negligible network overheads and no compromises on security in terms of orphaned weight due to forks.

        "Title": "A Distributed Clock Synchronization Protocol for Proof of Stake Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "In a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, all nodes need to be able to recognize approximately synchronized clocks. A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-based Scalable Ubiquitous Code Allocation Method Resilient to Congestion",
        "Abstract": "Recently, the demand for global identifiers has rapidly increased since IoT devices are widely used around the world. This indicates that we need to build a scalable and secure identification system. A blockchain is effective to resolve global identifier conflicts and to prove the legitimacy of the identifiers. However, the blockchain replication cost may become a bottleneck when allocation requests increase. Here, we propose a blockchain-based scalable allocation system for a ubiquitous code (ucode), which is a standardized global numerical identifier. In our system, a registrar bundles ucode allocation requests into a single transaction to reduce the replication cost. Based on the blockchain data generated from the transaction, the owner of each ucode space can provide a proof to claim his ownership. The proof mechanism requires registrants to wait for receiving proof data from the registrar. We analyze the trade-off between the waiting time and ucode allocation scalability. We also compare our proposal with the conventional methods and find that the proposed method enables more registrants to claim ucode ownerships.",

        "Title": "StreamChain: Building a Low-Latency Permissioned Blockchain For Enterprise Use-Cases",
        "Abstract": "Permissioned blockchains are a promising technology for secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains, which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in controlled environments with fast networking and low latency. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinking behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latency several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. In this work, we propose a fundamental shift in permissioned blockchain design, eliminating blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than Fabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming paradigm, enables further research, for instance, around reducing latency through relying on modern programmable hardware accelerators.",

        "Title": "Setchain: Improving Blockchain Scalability with Byzantine Distributed Sets and Barriers",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain implements a grow-only set object whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Moreover, since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster operations than on basic blockchains.",

This paper evaluates the performance of the Hyperledger Iroha framework based on three parameters: (a) total requests per seconds (RPS) over time; (b) response times in milliseconds over time; and (c) number of users in the network over time. The results indicate that the integration of Hyperledger Iroha with a major livestock management and trading platform in the UK, can support at least 200 participants with no errors in the network. Additionally, the total requests per second can reach as high as 40.6, and the response times are in the order of a fraction of a second.

        "Abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model is an efficient solution that not only solves the problem of the agricultural product's origin but also provides a method to share the market risk between consumers and producers. In the CSA model, consumers order and pay for products in advance. Then, the producers will send packages of fresh products to consumers after a fixed period corresponding to the paid amount. However, the critical weakness of the CSA model is the lack of solutions for both sides to demonstrate the product's quality, which makes consumers unsure about the condition of receiving products. In consequence, consumers become hesitant to order and pay money in advance. In this paper, we will propose a novel solution that allows consumers to track their products through agricultural diaries recorded by farmers every day. The key difference of the proposed solution is to leverage Blockchain technology advantages in authenticating and protecting the integrity of information. Such that, consumers could track all steps in the production process quickly and reliably. Meanwhile, producers can build and increase their enterprise branding by transferring product information transparently and responsibly.",

        "Abstract": "Both the number of blockchains and the discovered number of applications of blockchain are ever-increasing. Understanding how different blockchains compare in performance has become more important than ever, yet each blockchian paper uses its own inconsistent standards for performance analysis. There are few mechanisms that may allow for consistent performance analysis among multiple blockchains. This paper details the implementation of the first-ever multi-layer blockchain parameter tuning system: Parameter Space Exploration. Our system is primarily targeted at the performance issue but also takes into consideration power consumption. Multi-layer blockchains use a permissioned blockchain to solve performance deficits. We find that the side chain is the determining factor for the performance of a multi-layer system; our side chain is chosen among a set of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Crash Fault Tolerance (CFT) based consensus algorithms as they are more energy-efficient and have higher performance than their Proof of Work (PoW) counterparts. Our proposed Parameter Space Exploration has two elements: (1) The concept of a parameter space; (2) A side-by-side benchmarking system for balanced comparison among different multi-layer blockchains and consensus algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Suppose that Alice plans to buy a physical good from Bob over a programmable Blockchain. Alice does not trust Bob, so she is not willing to pay before the good is delivered off-chain. Similarly, Bob does not trust Alice, so he is not willing to deliver the good before getting paid on-chain. Moreover, they are not inclined to use the services of a trusted third-party. Traditionally, such scenarios are handled by game-theoretic escrow smart contracts, such as BitHalo. In this work, we first show that the common method for this problem suffers from a major flaw which can be exploited by Bob in order to extort Alice. We also show that, unlike the case of auctions, this flaw cannot be addressed by a commitment-scheme-based approach. We then provide a much more general result: assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.**A preprint of this work appeared in [1].",

By linking the Hash value of the traceability information of the final sales stage to the consortium blockchain as a transaction, the safety and reliability of the scheme are enhanced. The private blockchain is used to collect and track the traceability information, while the consortium blockchain is to tamper with and verify the traceability information.",

        "Abstract": "In the past few years, cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications has been one of the most rapidly emerging fields of computer science, leading to a strong demand of software applications. Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US$), Bitfinex in 2016 (72 million US$), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.",

        "Abstract": "As data marketplaces are becoming common place, it is also becoming clear that data streams generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices hold value for potential third party consumers. We envision a marketplace for IoT data streams that can unlock such potential value in a scalable way, by enabling any pairs of data providers and consumers to engage in data exchange transactions without any prior assumption of mutual trust. We present a marketplace model and architecture to support trading of streaming data, from the advertising of data assets to the stipulation of legally binding trading agreements, to their fulfilment and payment settlement. Crucially, we show that by using blockchain technology and Smart Contracts in particular, we can offer participants a trade-off between the cost of transactional data exchange, and the risk of data loss when trading with untrusted third parties. We experimentally assess such trade-offs on a testbed using Ethereum Smart Contracts.",

        "Abstract": "Employment and workforce industry become more important because the human capital value is linked to the company's profitability. Company becomes employee-centric in the 21st century. To hire an appropriate employee, and reduce hiring liability workplace violence, background screening marketing growth quickly. However, in the human resource industry, background check still is a pain point, especially for employment, education, and skill verification. The traditional background check is prolonged and inaccurate. For overseas recruitment, background check will be more troublesome. This paper comprehensively addresses the challenge of the education, employment and skill verification problem. We propose an innovation E^2 C-Chain which is a two-stage blockchain based education, employment and skill certification system. In the first stage, the new blocks are created when a trust organization verifies the education and employment information of the employee. In the second stage, to encourage the verifiers to participate in the skill verification process, we employ a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game based incentive mechanism to find the Nash Equilibrium and ensure social cost minimization. We also present the theoretical proofs and extensive simulations to demonstrate beneficial properties and efficiency of our proposed system.",

        "Abstract": "With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs), their devices have been collecting our personal data to enhance our life styles and their purposes. Care must be taken when handling such sensitive data to protect the data owners' privacy while guaranteeing the integrity when the data is accessed by a third party. Furthermore, data should be available without much delay to support medical emergencies. Unfortunately, IoT devices may be limited with storage and computational resources to operate highly secure operations and respond to data requests. In this paper, we propose SSP, a novel mechanism that protects the privacy and integrity of the data collected by IoT devices without having a single point of failure, while minimizing the cryptographic operations that must be performed on IoT devices. SSP utilizes the blockchain data structure for availability and integrity, and Multi-Party-Computations (MPC) for privacy protection. We implemented SSP in C/C++ and according to our evaluation results, SSP is efficient in computation, communication, and storage operations on IoT devices.",

Although there are many researches worked on various time-lock systems, they may have some shortcomings like uncertainty in decryption time, not fully decentralized, hard to estimate the required computing resources. In this paper, we proposed a protocol and a reliable encryption scheme to make time-sensitive message be opened on time at a fully decentralized environment, which is then integrated with the blockchain to adapt to different computing power situations. The method also provides the capability of incorporating with appropriate incentives for encouraging participants to contribute their computing resources, which makes our system more suitable for real world applications.",

However, legacy systems built over decades using different technology stacks, make collaboration challenging and hinder efficiency. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and implementation of a proof of concept (POC) of a blockchain based interoperability and data sharing system that allows PSOs to seamlessly collaborate and share information in real time. The POC is based on the Registration of Overseas Entities and Beneficial Owners (ROEBO) legislation in the UK and demonstrates interactions between Companies House UK and other PSOs in a hybrid blockchain setting.",

        "Abstract": "The fast digital transformation the world experienced in the past few decades has created a multitude of information resources distributed over the Internet and accessed by many different entities. The sharing of these resources needs to be secure and trustworthy to protect the privacy of data and data providers. Privacy and reliability are major concerns especially in blockchain-based data storage systems, as data are held by different owners. Each data provider tries to increase its share of profit by collaborating with other data providers. To ensure secure data sharing in such a decentralized environment, authentication and verification of shared data is needed. This paper proposes a mutual authentication mechanism based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) using hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) to provide anonymity and integrity during the communication process in blockchain-based data sharing. To evaluate the fairness of profit sharing based on data providers' contributions and data utility, we propose the use of the Shapley value techniques. The performed security analysis demonstrates that our proposed approach is resilient against replay, secret disclosure, and traceability attacks.",

One approach is market-based task allocation (TA) which faces challenges related to fraud and intransparency. Integrating blockchain technology (BCT) into TA enables transparency and tamper resistance. It also allows for the downstream integration of financial transactions in CPPS. This paper proposes a method for two-stage market-based TA in CPPS enabled by BCT. A formal definition for a reverse first-price-sealed-bid auction including the payment process is presented for the blockchain-based two-stage auctioning in a CPPS. The proposed method is implemented in a prototype and tested with a focus on scalability. Transaction times and costs are considered within the experiments. The evaluation reveals that the proposed process is functionable and that financial transactions can be completely automated within CPPS. The time and gas usage of transactions scale in most scenarios and only take a few seconds for completion.",

While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f+1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.",

Motivated by exploring the potential categories of NFRs that dominate the landscape of blockchain-based systems, we conducted an inductive content analysis on a sample of extracted requirements from 7 different blockchain-based projects developed by two startup firms. This paper presents the initial view of the constructed mapping between the blockchain characteristics on one side and the dominating NFRs for the blockchain-based system.",

        "Abstract": "Telecom operators are deploying the fifth generation (5G) networks around the world which promises high information transmission rate, wide network coverage, low communication delay, and easy access to a large number of devices. However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures. This paper firstly discusses the merits of blockchain technology and the benefits of integrating it with 5G networks. Then a variety of applications of blockchain technology in telecom network operation are reviewed, including spectrum sharing, international roaming settlement, network operation management, number selection management and supply chain management. In the end, we show our recently advance in integrating blockchain in 5G by introducing a multi framework based blockchain service network architecture deployed in real environment.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has gained a lot of visibility in recent years due to its characteristics of transparency and immutability. Many studies have been carried out in order to use this technology in the financial industry, but there are still issues regarding scalability that need to be resolved before the technology can be used. In the literature there are works that perform Blockchain performance analysis of the private model, making comparisons between different platforms. However, no work was found regarding the analysis of the impact that changing parameters has on the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In this context, this article introduces PriBB that contributes to the literature regarding the proposal of a benchmark to evaluate the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on the impact that the parameters of block size and interval between blocks have on the performance of applications, since no equivalent work has been found in the literature. The PriBB was evaluated in a real data center environment and aims to assist in the optimization of parameterization of Blockchain applications of the private model. The results are promising and demonstrate that a given parameter can impact more than 100 times the performance in running Blockchain applications.",

        "Title": "Enabling Privacy and Traceability in Supply Chains using Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proofs",
        "Abstract": "In recent years there have been increased efforts to make supply chains transparent and traceable to better protect the end consumer's interests against counterfeiting, contamination, false claims, and inadequate processes. The actors in the supply chain can also leverage additional visibility to proactively tune their operations in response to upstream or downstream disruptions. Blockchain technology, with its promise of immutability, transparency, and provenance is a natural fit to supply chain problems. Several works have discussed the improved design of supply chains leveraging blockchain technology. There have been attempts to address some of the privacy concerns of participants on the blockchain network by using encryption schemes to hide confidential data and group signatures to hide the participant identities. But these do not handle the complexities of the supply chain, where items are constantly packaged, repackaged, and transformed before reaching the end consumer. Our work presents a blockchain-based model for the supply chain that provides privacy and traceability with efficient contamination tracing while accounting for the aforementioned complexities of the supply chain operations. The last property enables an end consumer to be convinced about a product to be unaffected by identified faulty upstream processes (contamination) without access to the entire history of the product. Our solution makes novel use of cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic accumulators to provide these guarantees. The choice of the cryptographic components is grounded in concrete efficiency, and we present an experimental evaluation of the implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular platform for enterprise blockchains.",

        "Title": "Context-based consensus for appendable-block blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g., smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain networks are mainly used in financial verification processes, the most famous of which is the Bitcoin network consisting of a huge number of nodes. Expansion of blockchain technology, however, to other areas, such as healthcare, arts, culture, and entertainment, is being considered internationally. Especially important challenges for ensuring the reliability of blockchain networks and the security of peer-to-peer networks are shortening the block propagation times throughout a blockchain network to reduce fork and preventing malicious eclipse attacks against targeted nodes in a network. Previous methods have tried to increase the block propagation speed at the expense of imposing a higher burden on each node and a higher risk of eclipse attack. This paper proposes a new neighbor selection method based on the neighbor's regional information. That is, each node has a relatively small number neighbors located outside its region. By using this simple method, the distribution of blocks throughout the network becomes faster and the random neighbor selection nature in a blockchain network is kept intact; thus, risk of eclipse attack is low.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain-based applications have been recently introduced in communication networks. Different applications require different levels of service whereas existing blockchain-based applications mostly provide a single class of service. In this paper, we propose a multi-class blockchain services (MCBS) framework that prioritizes the processing of time-critical blockchain-based applications in communication networks. We model MCBS as a queueing system and derive the average service times for the different classes. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the average service time and aggregate transactions arrival rate. The numerical results show that existing blockchains may not satisfy the requirements of time-critical applications whereas a high priority queue in MCBS may meet the requirement. In addition, we analyze MCBS under double-spend attacks and show that with maximum attacker hash power, the blockchain system can still be stable if the aggregate transaction arrival rate is lower than half of its maximum achievable value.",

        "Title": "Agent-based Modelling of Bitcoin Consensus without Block Rewards",
        "Abstract": "Trust is key to the efficient functioning of any fiat or crypto-currency and so is for the consensus algorithm behind the functioning of blockchain systems. By an arbitrary design choice, Bitcoin and most Proof-of- Work (PoW) blockchains have a limited supply. Once block rewards vanish, only transaction fees will remain as an incentive for miners to partake in the verification process. In this paper, we analyse the impact that miners bargaining over block composition has on consensus in the absence of block rewards: in this situation, competing blocks at the same height may be more attractive to peers by including less transactions (i.e. sharing the mempool). The mining and acceptance of blocks can be modelled as an Ulti-matum Game, where miners' strategies represent their fairness sentiment. Extending previous Literature, our study focuses on the effect of the transaction arrival rate on global consensus in the system and whether local consensus is formed under certain assumptions about the strategies of miners. We find that consensus is threatened when the supply of transactions is low and stable consensus only emerges when the amount of unconfirmed transactions remains sufficient. In addition, when miners are set with randomised strategies, it is more difficult for the system to achieve consensus. Our research suggests that transitioning from a block reward incentive to a transaction fee incentive may weaken and even destroy the consensus of PoW-based systems.",

In our solution, learning nodes, in addition to their computational duties, act as off-chain provers submitting proofs to attest computational correctness of param-eters that can be verified on the blockchain. We demonstrate and evaluate our solution through a health monitoring use case and proof-of-concept implementation leveraging the ZoKrates language and tools for smart contract-based on-chain model management.

        "Abstract": "One of the backbone technology of Blockchains is cryptography. In simpler terms cryptography is the mathematical art of secret writing, however it's applications are not limited to writing secret codes only. Essentially cryptography is used to achieve three main security goals namely confidentiality (in-formation must be hidden from the unintended users), integrity (information must be prevented from illicit modifications) and availability (information must be readily available to intended users at all times). In cryptography confidentiality is achieved by employing a technique called as Encryption, integrity is achieved by employing special one way functions called as Cryptographic Hash Functions and authentication (process for verifying identity of the sender) is achieved by employing a technique called as Digital Signatures. For better understanding about the working of Blockchain it is essential to understand cryptographic concepts on which Blockchain is built. This paper presents the brief overview of such cryptographic concepts. In particular this papers throws light on the cryptographic concepts used to build Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains. Furthermore this paper also throws light on the need and requirements of post-quantum cryptographic primitives for post-quantum Blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "Attacks targeting several millions of non-internet based application users are on the rise. These applications such as SMS and USSD typically do not benefit from existing multi-factor authentication methods due to the nature of their interaction interfaces and mode of operations. To address this problem, we propose an approach that augments blockchain with multi-factor authentication based on evidence from blockchain transactions combined with risk analysis. A profile of how a user performs transactions is built overtime and is used to analyse the risk level of each new transaction. If a transaction is flagged as high risk, we generate n-factor layers of authentication using past endorsed blockchain transactions. A demonstration of how we used the proposed approach to authenticate critical financial transactions in a blockchain-based asset financing platform is also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Content sharing platforms such as Youtube and Vimeo have promoted pay per view models for artists to monetize their content. Yet, artists remain at the mercy of centralized platforms that control content listing and advertisement, with little transparency and fairness in terms of number of views or revenue. On the other hand, consumers are distanced from the publishers and cannot authenticate originality of the content. In this paper, we develop a reliable and fair platform for content sharing without a central facilitator. The platform is built as a decentralized data storage layer to store and share content in a fault-tolerant manner, where the peers also participate in a blockchain network. The blockchain is used to manage content listings and as an auditable and fair marketplace transaction processor that automatically pays out the content creators and the storage facilitators using smart contracts. We demonstrate the system with the blockchain layer built on Hyperledger Fabric and the data layer built on Tahoe-LAFS, and show that our design is practical and scalable with low overheads.",

        "Abstract": "Decentralized finance has grown up dramatically in recent years, covering various cryptocurrency or blockchain financial applications. With the support of blockchain technology, people have shown great enthusiasm and trust in decentralized financial services. However, due to sharing personal information with other institutions, users' privacy and data security will be difficult to be guaranteed. Moreover, various encryption methods such as homomorphic encryption focus on protecting the data stored on the blockchain, but few enhance client-side data security. Motivated by this condition, we develop an image-based privacy-preserving scheme to store users' financial service data as images. Transferring the numerical service data into images ensures that users can comprehend the content and prevent data recognized by the machine. We evaluate our scheme through conducting numerical evaluations from image attack effectiveness and smart contract functions' efficiency analysis.",

Following the travel rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) should exchange personal identity information of originator and beneficiary when transferring virtual assets. In this paper, we propose CODE, a novel decentralized blockchain-based travel rule compliance system. Since blockchain does not need any third party, it can eliminate the possibility of massive data leakage due to centralization. It also ensures secure management of travel rule data. We developed a system that uses Corda as a blockchain platform. According to the characteristics of Corda, data are only shared between related parties. Our system also provides an address-search method to verify the beneficiary's identity in real-time. An originator requests virtual asset transfer using only the beneficiary's virtual asset address. By joining the Corda network and installing the proposed system developed in the form of a CorDapp, any VASP can easily use this system to exchange travel rule data.",

        "Title": "On the Storage Overhead of Proof-of-Work Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have long been criticized for their high computational and storage overhead. Unfortunately, while a number of proposals address the energy consumption of existing Proof-of-Work deployments, little attention has been given so far to remedy the storage overhead incurred by those blockchains. In fact, it seems widely acceptable that full nodes supporting the blockchains have to volunteer hundreds of GBs of their storage, to store and verify all transactions exchanged in the system. In this paper, we explore the solution space to effectively reduce the storage footprint of Proof-of-Work based blockchains. To do so, we analyze, by means of thorough empirical measurements, how existing full blockchain nodes utilize data from the shared ledger to validate incoming transactions/blocks. Based on this analysis, we show that it is possible for full nodes to locally reduce their storage footprint to approximately 15 GB, without any modification to the underlying protocol. We also discuss other client-side strategies to further reduce the storage footprint while incurring negligible computational overhead on the nodes.",

        "Title": "The Energy Footprint of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms Beyond Proof-of-Work",
        "Abstract": "Popular permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems using proof-of-work (PoW) for Sybil attack resistance have extreme energy requirements, drawing stern criticism from academia, business and the media. DLT systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.",

The authorization policies are defined by the accepting SDP hosts. The policy can be recorded into the ledger, and then the authorization is implemented by the SDP controllers in the blockchain. The policy can also be kept by the accepting SDP host because of the privacy preserving, and then the authorization is implemented by the accepting SDP hosts themselves.

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology on the platform business becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility, and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers (SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients. The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform business are (i) how SPs' participation is reflected on its quality of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs.",

        "Abstract": "The fast development of Blockchain technology makes it widely applied in several fields of digital transactions, like e-government affairs and the protection of financial transactions. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption-based Blockchain for circuit copyright protection that effectively addresses the issues in the protection of circuit copyright transactions, such as low security of private data, low efficiency in transaction data storage, cooperation and supervision. First, we establish a homomorphic encryption-based mathematical model by utilizing Blockchain and intelligent contract, and next, the algorithms that include Blockchain generation, homomorphic chain encryption/decryption, and intelligent contract are designed. As the intelligent contract is correctly executed in Blockchain, a fully homomorphic encryption-based identity authentication protocol is tackled for Blockchain, given that it ensures the change operation of any third-party in Blockchain and realizes real-time verification. The system is apposite for circuit copyright protection in a blockchain network, due to the use of distributed identity authentication and real-time extensible storage improves the security and extensibility of blockchain-based circuit copyright protection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has reduced the transmission cost and improved the efficiency of data storage and supervision. In addition, it is resilient to several common attacks (e.g., double-spending attacks), yet incurs low cost/overhead and has a higher level of security when compared to three other competing algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-to-end privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.",

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that in most cases should be immutable\u2014that is, the information (transactions) that is written to the ledger cannot be modified or deleted. The chapter covers many of the vulnerabilities in the threat landscape that a blockchain network could be exposed to, including distributed denial\u2010of\u2010service attacks and 51% attacks. In Ethereum blockchains, all modifications to a smart contract's data must be performed by its blockchain code. Security is built into the blockchain code and the smart contract platform. The chapter reviews the blockchain\u2010specific features for Ethereum, Hyperledger, Quorum, and Corda. Ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda, and Quorum all offer unique security and privacy features and capacity that should be considered in IT Administrator blockchain design and deployments.",

        "Abstract": "IoT devices are quickly becoming a critical source of information about the physical world considered in business processes. Blockchains are a promising platform for such processes if they involve multiple parties with no shared, commonly trusted IT infrastructure. Transacting with a blockchain, however, requires software whose footprint overwhelms many lightweight IoT devices. In this paper we introduce the concept of a blockchain proxy to which an IoT device can offload a large part of this software footprint. The proxy only requires a slim proxy SDK on the device that holds a regular blockchain identity with its own private key, retaining full control of the transactions in the device. We discuss security implications and present cold-chain monitoring as a use case. Preliminary results show significant savings in CPU time and communication bandwidth for the IoT device.",

This obviates or diminishes the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with all their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem and market manipulation demerits.

However, most current fast-booming blockchain platforms keep bringing new fashion features, which will bring the cost of breaking changes between different releases of the platform. This can be a barrier for developers especially beginners to start their development. To resolve such issue, in this work, we introduce a smart contract development platform called DevLeChain, which comes with unified access method, easy-to-understand development workflow, and constant design philosophy. DevLeChain can provide an easy toolset to customize and control the underlying blockchain's behavior, whereby developers can easily start developing blockchain-based systems. Also, the provided smart contract automation testing tools allow developers to quickly realize their code.",

        "Title": "ClaimChain: Secure Blockchain Platform for Handling Insurance Claims Processing",
        "Abstract": "Insurance claims processing involves multi-domain entities and multi-source data, along with a number of human-agent interactions. Consequently, this processing is traditionally manually-intensive and time-consuming. Blockchain technology-based platforms for intelligent automation can significantly improve the scale and response time of claims processing. However, there is a need to secure such platforms against fraud (e.g., duplicate claims) and the loss of data integrity caused due to cyber-attacks (e.g., Sybil attack). In this paper, we propose a novel \u201cClaimChain\u201d, a consortium Blockchain platform that transforms the state-of-the-art NICB/ISO database architecture approach through increased shared intelligence and participation of insurance companies. ClaimChain features include: (a) automation of insurance claim processing via implementation of a Blockchain infrastructure, (b) infrastructure-level threat modeling via attack tree formalism for data integrity attacks, and (c) application-level fraud modeling for identified prominent red flags through machine learning models and risk scoring on the basis of risk severity. We evaluate the scalability of ClaimChain by simulating realistically large number of Blockchain transactions of claim processing. Further, we show that data integrity attacks at the infrastructure-level can be mitigated (as seen in reduction of 24% probability in loss) through implementation of security design principles. We also perform fraud-detection over an open dataset in ClaimChain to show how machine learning models can detect fraudulent activity with 98% accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud storage enables users to upload, store and download their data. However, with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices, such as camera, the cloud not only manages the user generate data but also devices generated data. This increment in the volume of outsourced data has raised two important issues in big data management for cloud storage servers, namely, optimal data storage and data security. In order to solve the former issue, cloud storage employs a deduplication technique to avoids storing duplicate data; and uses encryption to solve the later issue. However, both these issues are orthogonal in nature. Thanks to convergent encryption that addresses both the issues simultaneously. Nevertheless, the existing approaches relies on proxy servers and put all the trust on third party, which is vulnerable to single point failure. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight decentralized encrypted cloud storage architecture called, Yugula, which maintains file confidentiality, removes the centralized data deduplication and increases file integrity by using blockchain. In particular, we discuss two approaches for file confidentiality with data deduplication: one uses double hashing and the other symmetric encryption. In order to show the efficiency and usability, we implemented the proposed architecture and showed its results in terms of high transaction throughput requirement for IoT data management in cloud storage.",

To solve this problem, a consensus performance optimisation method that integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) and PBFT is proposed in this research. Firstly, SVM is used to evaluate the trust of consensus nodes in blockchain network. By selecting a consensus node with a high degree of trust as the primary node to reduce the possibility of dishonest nodes as the primary node. Then, introduce a dynamic adjustment credit incentive mechanism to the blockchain network by reducing the consensus trust of malicious nodes and inactive nodes in the blockchain, which will improve the security of the supply chain system. Finally, the experimental results show that, comparing with the existing methods, the consensus node trust evaluation and credit incentive mechanism have improved the throughput and latency of the supply chain blockchain application.",

We use Bitcoin as the underlying blockchain model, and we develop a unidirectional channel model to execute the vetting procedure. In this vetting procedure, all users get a chance to vote for and against a content. Content with sufficient positive votes is considered as the vetted content. We optimize the offline channel network topology to reduce computation overhead due to using blockchains.

        "Abstract": "Maintaining land records is a difficult task for countries with large area and population. Having a central database server is not a 100% safe alternative to paper-based traditional records as it is susceptible to cyber-attacks and frauds. This paper proposes an idea to solve this issue using blockchain. The proposed land records system is based on a hybrid blockchain network. The existing land records are put on the blockchain by the government. All land sales transactions are recorded on this hybrid blockchain. These transactions are mined (verified) by a miner which is run on government authorized peers or nodes. These records or transactions cannot be tampered with. The citizens can view their owned lands and corresponding transactions but cannot make changes to any data on the blockchain. Being based on hybrid blockchain, this system is benefitted by advantages of both the types of blockchain-public and private and is more secure and reliable than databases and paper records.",

        "Title": "TAIRA-BSC - Trusting AI in Recruitment Applications through Blockchain Smart Contracts",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation fo...",

        "Abstract": "Many threshold systems require some kind of secret sharing during their set-up phase. There has been several recent work in doing secret sharing in a distributed manner through the use of Blockchain so that one does not have to rely on trusted third parties nor strong assumptions about the communication medium. This paper continues this line of work and presents a new protocol for distributed key generation (DKG). We develop a new technique that leverages the mainchain of a popular blockchain platform like Bitcoin, together with a mixing service and a group signature scheme, to provide anonymity and traceability; we connect this to a sidechain, pegged to the mainchain, that brings a better scalability. We implemented the technique on the joint platform Bitcoin/RootStock and use CoinJoin/CoinShuffle as the mixing service. The evaluation section shows a decrease by 99 % in the execution cost of our protocol compared to the same implementation on a smart-contract-friendly blockchain such as Ethereum.",

        "Abstract": "Data center (DC) interconnection allows us to have optical transmissions between DCs directly connected to optical networks, avoiding the use of a packet-based infrastructure. Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains. To do so, an experimental comparison on how the different abstraction models affect the performance of the blockchain system is presented.",

        "Abstract": "The low performance of blockchains has been considered as one of the main challenges in deploying blockchains. This blockchain performance has been discussed and analyzed for further improvements, especially in wired blockchains. In wired blockchains, transactions, messages for consensus protocols (CPs), and new blocks are all transmitted through wired links. However, even though wireless blockchains have actively emerged in recent years, most of blockchain works are still focused on wired blockchains. Being different from wired blockchains, transactions, messages for CPs, and new blocks can face the characteristics of wireless communications, such as limited communication resources, path loss, and higher interference. This is highly influential on the performance of wireless blockchains, especially on CPs that play an important role in fault tolerance inside blockchains. In this paper, therefore, we discuss the impacts of communications on wireless blockchains. We then provide trade-offs and future challenges, which need to be newly considered for higher performance in wireless blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is an immutable append-only decentralized ledger that theoretically makes it an ideal data storage system. The nature of blockchain design ensures stored data is reliable, trustworthy, and transparent. However, the blockchain's full-replication feature makes it ineffective to store a large volume of data directly on-chain. This paper provides a systematic review and analysis of existing decentralized file systems. Our focus was on systems that can support large, high-frequency data writing while still providing swift and easy data retrieval for blockchain-based applications. The challenge, in our view, is to find ways to achieve those efficiency outcomes while still retaining the key decentralized features of blockchain design. With that in mind, we assessed the costs involved in using nine state-of-the-art decentralized file systems and we also considered their latency performance.",

        "Abstract": "As the COVID-19 continues to spread globally, more and more companies are transforming into remote online offices, leading to the expansion of electronic signatures. However, the existing electronic signatures platform has the problem of data-centered management. The system is subject to data loss, tampering, and leakage when an attack from outside or inside occurs. In response to the above problems, this paper designs an electronic signature solution and implements a prototype system based on the consortium blockchain. The solution divides the contract signing process into four states: contract upload, initiation signing, verification signing, and confirm signing. The signing process is mapped with the blockchain-linked data. Users initiate the signature transaction by signing the uploaded contract's hash. The sign state transition is triggered when the transaction is uploaded to the blockchain under the consensus mechanism and the smart contract control, which effectively ensures the integrity of the electronic contract and the non-repudiation of the electronic signature. Finally, the blockchain performance test shows that the system can be applied to the business scenario of contract signing.",

        "Abstract": "Medical data sharing is increasingly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare management. Mobility of patients, healthcare financing, and changing modes of care require that health data pass from the institutions that generate the data to others that need it to support healthcare delivery outcomes. These factors lead to challenges that render the sharing arrangement necessary but vulnerable to attack by malicious users. The conventional paradigms of sharing do not include techniques for data control after access permissions are granted. Thus, the data exchange leaves patients at the risk of privacy breaches and institutions are exposed to punitive measures when protected health information in their care is compromised. Blockchain technology presents mechanisms to secure patients' data using cryptographically secure techniques with game\u2010theoretic models of behavior control. This chapter focuses on three paradigms of data sharing and ends with an exposition on some exceptional cases where the application of blockchain in medical data sharing has valuable contributions.",

As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages. In this article, we propose a proxy re-encryption approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data. With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a proxy server to handle intensive computations. Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth. Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systems and achieves fine-grained access control to data. The security analysis and evaluation of our scheme show the promise of our approach in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and security.",

        "Abstract": "In recent decades, video surveillance systems have become an indispensable management tool for cities. Managers can grasp the information of the scene without visiting the scene. Through the surveillance system, the effect of management and supervision can be improved, and the probability of major accidents can be reduced. However, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, video surveillance systems will face challenges such as massive equipment access, massive data, insufficient bandwidth, vulnerable to attack, and real-time monitoring difficulties. Based on the analysis of the research and application status of video surveillance system, we propose a video surveillance system based on permissioned blockchains (BCs) and edge computing. The system uses permissioned BCs, edge computing, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technology and convolution neural networks (CNNs). The edge computing is used to achieve large-scale wireless sensor information acquisition and data processing. IPFS storage service is used to realize massive video data storage, and CNNs technology is used to realize real-time monitoring.",

Since most blockchain nodes retain copies of the ledger, the blockchain brings the benefits of decentralization while also bringing privacy leakage issues. With the continuous development of blockchain applications, how to protect the privacy data on the blockchain platform is a very worthwhile research question. This paper first divides each blockchain transaction data into two parts: sensitive data and basic data, and then encrypts and hides the sensitive data into the HEVC video to protect the privacy transaction data of the blockchain. The experimental results show that this HEVC video steganography algorithm can effectively increase the privacy data embedding capacity and get good visual quality.",

It is a legal process which collects, examines, analyzes and reports the evidence. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned and private blockchain structure which includes the present estimation of the element's property and the historical backdrop of transactions. In forensic department, every piece of evidence should be properly identified, collected, preserved, analyzed and finally admitted to the proper authority. But in reality assembling, evaluating, storing evidence is not secured enough. So in this paper, we are focused on creating a blockchain based medical forensic system using Hyperledger. The system can track any unauthorized access and modification by retrieving the Historian Record and Asset Registries and thus guarantees the impartiality of evidence, secrecy and validity of transactions.",

        "Abstract": "As the backbone of the smart grid, smart metering systems enable customers, as well as utility companies, to have access to real-time information on consumption patterns in electricity, gas, and water. From a technical standpoint, smart metering systems (1) reduce the need to verify electricity, gas, and water consumption services, (2) allow for efficient management of electricity, gas, and water consumption patterns, and (3) protect natural resources. Additionally, smart metering systems provide a number of important functions that should be performed manually, such as automatic and remote measurement of electricity, gas, and water consumption, connect or disconnect service, tampering detection, outage identification and isolation, and collecting, aggregating, and analyzing real-time information of the fundamental parameters associated with customers\u2019 services, i.e., voltage, current, etc. Besides, considering the number of customers, there are several limitations to accessing and sharing the data between utility companies and customers, and therefore, reliable and secure communication infrastructure is needed. To resolve such issues, a conceptual and technological Blockchain-based system is developed to securely share the real-time collected data from a set of various sensors for monitoring and control of electricity, gas, and water consumption, namely the multifunctional integrated smart metering system. The proposed system takes advantage of a decentralized structure, connectivity of the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, data privacy, and transparency and auditability. The proposed Blockchain-based smart metering system allows customers to securely monitor their actual electricity, gas, and water consumption for a specific period of time and review the full history of consumption. This leads to finding solutions to rationalize the consumption of electricity, gas, and water resources.",

Network slicing enables the consumers to deliver individualized and customized telecommunication services on the commonly shared infrastructure. Slice brokering is the dedicated service to facilitate the tenants and resource providers in slice allocation process. We proposed SFSBroker (Secured and Federated Slice Broker) to leverage the slice brokering process with the application of game theory. We formulated the optimal slice selection problem into the Stackelberg game model. The computational logic has been incorporated on smart contracts. Furthermore, the proposed architecture includes Security Service Blockchain (SSB) which has been integrated for Denial of Service (DoS) attack prevention. We implemented the end to end setup including tenant request to slice creation using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, Katana slice manager, and OpenStack. In this demonstration, the system provisions to obtain hands-on experience on the end to end workflow of slice brokering process.",

To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an emergent technology applied initially to cryptocurrencies, but with a much further reach. We present a secure, transaction-based system that handles motorized vehicle provenance (including ownership) over a distributed model using smart contracts on a blockchain. The system model includes the specification of various security protocols, verified using AVISPA-SPAN tool and guaranteeing privacy, authenticity, and other security features. A client of the system can have different roles accordingly to the relationship it has with the vehicle, and it can get various services and request transactions accordingly. Our proposal might contribute to reduce fraud and expand the applications of Blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Consensus algorithms can be considered as the core of blockchain technology. Different algorithms provide various advantages and disadvantages to the platform, which can cause the variation in the aspects of scalability, reliability, security, and performance. Deploying a blockchain platform with a consensus algorithm that is not suitable for the situated scenario may lead to low efficiency, waste of energy, unfairness and more. As more businesses are trying to introduce blockchain into their system, there is a demand for selecting consensus algorithms that are suitable for a private chain. Most of the current consensus algorithms are Voting-based or PBFT-based. However, Voting-based algorithms may suffer much from leader-crash, while PBFT-based algorithms may experience network congestion when implemented in a huge network due to its broadcast-like confirmation steps. In this paper, we aim to propose a new type of consensus algorithm based solely on Random Number Generation, called Mosaic. The selection is not only due to its low computational cost compared to cryptographically proof-based algorithms, but also because of its acceptable unpredictability that makes the election fairer. In the evaluation, we demonstrate that Mosaic is more efficient than PBFT-based schemes in large-scale while also providing fault tolerance compared to Raft.",

To ensure the reproducibility of the AI model, the data items in the system were created based on the \u201cReproducibility list\u201d proposed by authoritative society for AI.

        "Title": "Decentralized Lightweight Detection of Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin Clients",
        "Abstract": "Clients of permissionless blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, rely on an underlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with other clients through contacted servers. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through real-world implementation. The results of our experiments indicate that the protocol incurs a negligible overhead, detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.",

        "Title": "Utilizing Parallelism in Smart Contracts on Decentralized Blockchains by Taming Application-Inherent Conflicts",
        "Abstract": "Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications. In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction exe-cution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and spe-cial commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we eval-uated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.",

        "Title": "A Solution to Data Accessibility Across Heterogeneous Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Cross-heterogeneous blockchain interactions have been attracting much attention due to their application in depository blockchains mutual access and cross-blockchain identity authentication. Trusted access across heterogeneous chains is gradually becoming a hot challenge. In order to ensure cross-blockchain trusted access, the majority of the current works focus on on-chain notaries and the relay chain model. However, these methods have the following drawbacks: 1) notaries on the chain are more vulnerable to attacks due to their high degree of centralization, which causes off-chain users to lose their trust and thus exacerbates the off-chain trust crisis; 2) although the relay model involves multiple parties in maintenance and supervision and enjoys a more robust trust, the paticipatant nodes are relatively fixed, which impose a terrible dilemma that invalid nodes cannot participate in consensus formation in a timely manner, thus progressively disrupting the connectivity of the relay across heterogeneous chains and eventually reducing the rate of trusted mutual access. In this article, we propose a novel general framework for cross-heterogeneous blockchain communication based on a periodical committee rotation mechanism to support information exchange of diverse transactions across multiple heterogeneous blockchain systems. Connecting heterogeneous blockchains through committees has a more robust trust than the notary method. In order to eliminate the impact of downtime nodes in a timely manner, we periodically reorganize the committee and give priority to replacing downed nodes to ensure the reliability of the system. In addition, a message-oriented verification mechanism is designed to improve the rate of trusted intervisit across heterogeneous chains. We have built a prototype of the scheme and conducted simulation experiments on the current mainstream blockchain for message exchange across heterogeneous chains. The results show that our solution has a good perfo...",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains can now be used to distribute digital assets independent of specific organizations. One way to handle digital assets on a blockchain is through tokens. Tokens define chunks of data on a blockchain, allowing it to be distributed like virtual currency. However, storing all data related to digital assets in a token is difficult. Data is currently managed separately because storing a large amount of data in a blockchain can cause the ledger to grow large. When the management of data depends on a particular organization, the stability of the token's value depends on that particular organization. In this paper, we propose an organization-independent management method that combines a distributed content-addressable file system with a blockchain. Our proposed method places the data associated with the token and the access information to the token into the distributed content-addressable file system. As a result, the token associated with the data has the sharing control of the data stored in the distributed content-addressable file system, and a configuration independent of the specific contract is realized.",

        "Title": "Multi-Batch Scheduling for Improving Performance of Hyperledger Fabric Based IoT Applications",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been regarded as a paradigm that enables enterprises to deploy decentralized Internet of things (IoT) applications, which require security, mutual truthfulness, privacy, and data reliability. However, the adoption of blockchain technology on IoT applications has been limited due to the lack of blockchain's capability to process a huge amount of transaction requests from IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new transaction processing mechanism, called Accelerator, which improves the performance of blockchain-based IoT applications in terms of transaction throughput and latency. Two key design ideas of Accelerator lie in: (i) independent modular structure that can be implemented without changing the incumbent blockchain network and (ii) adaptive multi-batch scheduling engine for robust performance. We first provide a mathematical analysis that is used to choose the parameters of Accelerator to maximize the performance. Moreover, we implement Accelerator on a decentralized blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and perform the extensive test using Hyperledger Caliper. We show that Accelerator achieves 8x transaction throughput improvement without sacrificing latency.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain specifications distributed ledger, traceability, immutability provide a secure high-speed voting system. Data stored on the blockchain cannot be traced back, edit or deleted due to which transparent and high-performance capabilities are inherent to the network. But as the information of the e-voting system increases storage space and processing cost also increases due to an increase in delay. This delay increases as the comparison of hash value with the existing hash value for uniqueness. Apart from the uniqueness of hash designer also required initial 8 bytes of hash to be zeros. In this paper, we propose the multiobjective genetic algorithm-based creation of a side-chain to enhance the scalability and performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system. We compare the storage cost and the processing cost of the state of the art models with the proposed model. our experiments yielded observations on the scalability and the performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system.",

        "Abstract": "This research focuses on designing a tracking system with blockchain technology to address the lack of transparency in supply chain flow in urban farming. Unlike the original distribution channel (farmers to consumers), this study proposes two distribution channels: a distribution channel with farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, and a distribution channel consisting of farmers, retailers, and consumers. A tracking system for suppliers and producers in an urban farming company is designed and implemented with peer-to-peer private blockchain technology using RFID, Raspberry Pi, Golang, and BitTorrent protocols. The study result helps to narrow the gap in theoretical and practical literature research on blockchain technology in supply chain management. It shows how blockchain technology supports tracking systems for suppliers and producers to minimize data falsification and maximize transparency between related parties for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) supply chains in Indonesia. Further study can be done to create a real-time system where researchers can develop a real-time peer-to-peer system.",

        "Abstract": "with the existence of the new revolution of software techniques, tampering with the videos became easier than ever. For retaining the integrity of the captured scenes, novel methods are required. Blockchain is now one of the most interesting integrity verification techniques. Blockchain provides trust among the participant nodes; \"users\" without the need of a trusted third party. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based framework for integrity verification of videos. In the proposed framework, the scene is captured and hashed in its original state and the captured frame; \"video frame\" is stored as a reference frame. The hash value, frame name, and timestamp of the capturing time are stored in a CSV file. The genesis block of a permissioned blockchain is created with this data. Other frames are captured for the same scene every predefined period and hashed. If the new hash value is identical to the reference hash, then the new frame is deleted to preserve storage space, and the metadata of the frame is stored in the same CSV file. If the hash values are not identical, then the name of the frame is changed to the timestamp of the capturing time, the frame then is propagated to all participant nodes, an email is sent to a predefined mail to take the appropriate action, and finally, a new block will be created with the new metadata. The proposed system ensures the integrity of the captured videos, ease to use and robustness.",

Be it food, drug or luxury items, all kinds of industrial manufacturers and distributors are now seeking greater transparency in supply chain operations with a view to deter counterfeiting. This paper introduces a decentralized Blockchain based application system (DApp) with a view to identifying counterfeit products in the supply chain system. With the rapid rise of Blockchain technology, it has become known that data recorded within Blockchain is immutable and secure. Hence, the proposed project here uses this concept to handle the transfer of ownership of products. A consumer can verify the product distribution and ownership information scanning a Quick Response (QR) code generated by the DApp for each product linked to the Blockchain.",

However, with the rising popularity of this new paradigm, the concept of blockchain shifted greatly to the point where many systems marketed as \"blockchain\" without sharing the key components introduced by Bitcoin. It has therefore become quite challenging for system designers or decision-makers to achieve a sufficient understanding of different types of existing blockchains or to design and adopt the correct blockchain solution. To overcome this problem, we propose DCEA a holistic reference model for conceptualizing and closely examining blockchains and globally distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using a layer-wise framework that envisions all these systems as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers.",

        "Title": "A Blockchain-based Testing Approach for Collaborative Software Development",
        "Abstract": "Development of large-scale and complex software systems requires multiple teams, including software development teams, domain experts, user representatives, and other project stakeholders, to work collaboratively to achieve software development goals. These teams rely on the use of agreed software development processes, knowledge management tools, and communication channels collaboratively in the software development project. Software testing is an important and complicated process due to reasons such as difficulties in achieving testing goals with the given time constraint, absence of efficient data sharing policies, vague testing acceptance criteria at various levels of testing, and lack of trusted coordination among the teams involved in software testing. The efficiency of the software testing relies on efficient, reliable, and trusted information sharing among these teams. Existing approaches to software testing for collaborative software development use centralized or decentralize tools for software testing, knowledge management, and communication channels. Existing approaches have the limitations of centralized authority, a single point of failure/compromise, lack of automatic requirement compliance checking and transparency in information sharing, and lack of unified data sharing policy, and reliable knowledge management repositories for sharing and storing past software testing artifacts and data. In this paper, a software testing approach for collaborative software development using private blockchain is presented, and the desirable properties of private blockchain, such as distributed data management, tamper-resistance, auditability and automatic requirement compliance checking, are incorporated to greatly improve the quality of software testing for collaborative software development.",
