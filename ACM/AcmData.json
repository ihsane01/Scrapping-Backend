        "Abstract": "Inspired by an industry initiative to address the celebrated market for lemons (poor-quality used cars), we investigate how incentives for a permissioned blockchain-based system in the automobile ecosystem can be designed to ensure high-quality data storage and use by different stakeholders. The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms. Furthermore, we explore incentive design in permissioned blockchains and discuss its latest implications.",

        "Abstract": "A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications (DApps). Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the \u201coracle problem\u201d and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs) connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This paper studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants\u2019 stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state-of-the-art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.",

        "Title": "Developing Cost-Effective Blockchain-Powered Applications: A Case Study of the Gas Usage of Smart Contract Transactions in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform",
        "Abstract": "Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes smart contracts. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, transaction issuers choose how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). The final transaction fee corresponds to the gas price times the gas usage. Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from these transaction fees. The flexibility and the inherent complexity of the gas system pose challenges to the development of blockchain-powered applications. Developers of blockchain-powered applications need to translate requests received in the frontend of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Yet, it is unclear how developers should set the gas parameters of these transactions given that (i) miners are free to prioritize transactions whichever way they wish and (ii) the gas usage of a contract transaction is only known after the transaction is processed and included in a new block. In this article, we analyze the gas usage of Ethereum transactions that were processed between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium era). We discover that (i) most miners prioritize transactions based on their gas price only, (ii) 25% of the functions that received at least 10 transactions have an unstable gas usage (coefficient of variation = 19%), and (iii) a simple prediction model that operates on the recent gas usage of a function achieves an R-Squared of 0.76 and a median absolute percentage error of 3.3%. We conclude that (i) blockchain-powered application developers should be aware that transaction prioritization in Ethereum is frequently done based solely on the gas price of transactions (e.g., a higher transaction fee does not necessarily imply a higher transaction priority) and act accordingly and (ii) blockchain-powered application developers can leverage gas usage prediction models similar to ours to make more informed decisions to set the gas price of their transactions. Lastly, based on our findings, we list and discuss promising avenues for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.",

        "Abstract": "Human genomic data carry unique information about an individual and offer unprecedented opportunities for healthcare. The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, poses major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide a secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this article, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.",

        "Title": "Data Privacy Based on IoT Device Behavior Control Using Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals\u2019 quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner\u2019s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.",

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.",

        "Title": "A Supply-chain System Framework Based on Internet of Things Using Blockchain Technology",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.",

        "Abstract": "Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the integration of the supply chain and blockchain is promising, as blockchain successfully eliminates the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. Generally, concurrent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus method, named C-PBFT, is powerful to deal with the consensus inefficiencies, caused by the fast node expansion in the supply chain. However, due to the tremendous complicated transactions in the supply chain, it remains challenging to select the credible primary peers in the concurrent clusters. To address this challenge, the peers in the supply chain are classified into several clusters by analyzing the historic transactions in the ledger. Then, the primary peer for each cluster is identified by reputation assessment. Finally, the performance of C-PBFT is evaluated by conducting experiments in Fabric.",

        "Abstract": "Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications are the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond the current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and providing parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the approaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However, the current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during cross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different shards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This issue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires additional consensus for cross-shard communications. Relying on the advantages of hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and 2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the properties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS chain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid consensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture provides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency conflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is demonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical concurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in providing optimal sharding.",

        "Title": "Enabling Short-Term Energy Flexibility Markets Through Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE\u2019s attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.",

        "Abstract": "The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.",

The wireless communication would have been the largest research area that allows users to communicate with each other. Nowadays, high-speed, smart, efficient with many technologies, such as low power consumption, and so on, appear to be available to communicate with each other in today's globe. Throughout this framework, the expansion of fog features is enabled for physical objects within IoT. Several of the challenging issues in the field of wireless communications would be to build a new blockchain-based virtualization system across the IoT architecture.

        "Abstract": "In recent years, vaccine incidents occurred around the world, which endangers people\u2019s lives. In the technical respect, these incidents are partially due to the fact that existing vaccine management systems are distributively managed by different entities in the vaccine supply chain. This architecture makes it relatively easy to modify or even delete the vaccine circulation data maliciously, which makes tracing problematic vaccine hard and identifying the responsibility for a vaccine accident hard. To solve these issues, this article presents a blockchain-based solution to protect the whole process of vaccine circulation. We first propose a model to supervise the vaccine circulation process by incorporating existing regulatory practices. Then, we propose a blockchain-based tracing system to implement this model. The proposed system takes the blockchain as a global, unique, and verifiable database to store all the circulation data. Through data insertions and queries on the global and unique database, the proposed system achieves the protection of vaccine circulation. We also implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed system. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system is beneficial.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the large number of resources that blockchain has, and continues to mobilize, it is not yet fully understood what makes the technology unique and why people engage with it. Hence, \u201cWhy Blockchain?\u201d is a question that many scientists and managers still ask themselves or have to answer when facing the technology's critics. While the question is undoubtedly justified, it cannot always be answered from a purely technical perspective. Thus, in this study, we apply a socio-technical IS artifact perspective and analyze the reasons managers involved in blockchain consortia have for using blockchain technology. Based on a multiple-case study of 19 blockchain consortia, including interviews with 53 stakeholders, we explicate 19 different motives that justify engagement with the technology in practice. Further, we identify the systemic character of tokenization and the importance of the socio-technical interplay of aspects like power decentralization that justify the necessity of blockchain",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology and New Public Governance (NPG) represent promising concepts for various researchers. As such, both concepts offer the vision of an altered relationship between public administration and its non-public actors by emphasizing a strong position of non-public actors for public service delivery. This research aims to identify the relevance of NPG to leading blockchain implementations in the European public sector. For this purpose, both topics are combined in an explorative analysis. The analysis leverages an adapted analysis framework designed for this research effort to structure the expectations around NPG. Qualitative interviews with multiple key stakeholders of blockchain implementations projects were conducted to understand the actual impact of blockchain on the actor's relationships for public service delivery. This article presents the findings to this question and concludes that the use of blockchain has the changed actor relationships only in parts. Consequently, the author finally draws attention to the importance of blockchain governance and blockchain regulation for further developing the relationships of public administrations and their non-public counterparts.",

These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a \u201cpreventive\u201d measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a \u201cdetective\u201d measure like the use of mirror websites.

Ring signature-based schemes allow multiple participants cooperatively to manage while preserving their individuals\u2019 privacy. However, the solutions cannot work properly due to the increased computing complexity along with the expanded group size. In this article, we propose a Multi-center Anonymous Blockchain-based (MAB) system, with joint management for the consortium and privacy protection for the participants. To achieve that, we formalize the syntax used by the MAB system and present a general construction based on a modular design. By applying cryptographic primitives to each module, we instantiate our scheme with anonymity and decentralization. Furthermore, we carry out a comprehensive formal analysis of our exemplified scheme. A proof of concept simulation is provided to show the feasibility.

        "Title": "How Can Incentive Mechanisms and Blockchain Benefit with Each Other? A Survey",
        "Abstract": "In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has been widely deployed in various fields, such as finance, education, and public services. Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed peer-to-peer power energy markets are emerging quickly. Due to central governance and lack of effective information aggregation mechanisms, energy trading cannot be efficiently scheduled and tracked. We devise a new distributed energy transaction system over the energy Industrial Internet of Things based on predictive analytics, blockchain, and smart contract technologies. We propose a solution for scheduling distributed energy sources based on the Minimum Cut Maximum Flow theory. Blockchain is used to record transactions and reach consensus. Payment clearing for the actual power consumption is executed via smart contracts. Experimental results on real data show that our solution is practical and achieves a lower total cost for power energy consumption.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-Based Audio Watermarking Technique for Multimedia Copyright Protection in Distribution Networks",
        "Abstract": "Copyright protection in multimedia protection distribution is a challenging problem. To protect multimedia data, many watermarking methods have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them cannot be used effectively in a multimedia distribution network (MDN) as they are not designed to support multi-layer watermark embedding. Multi-layer watermarking mechanisms were developed to protect multimedia data across different layers in an MDN. However, in those mechanisms, we need to trust the entities in the MDN, such as regional and country distributors. To overcome this potential drawback, in this article, we propose a novel privacy protection mechanism for MDNs by combining the advantages of both blockchain and watermarking technologies. A specifically designed watermarking algorithm is used to link the copyright information with the audio file, while a novel blockchain-based smart contract mechanism is developed to enforce the proper functioning of each entity in the distribution network. Moreover, the new audio mechanism is computationally efficient. Although audio signals are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the proposed approach can easily be extended to other multimedia objects, such as an image. The validity of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by our simulation results. The proposed mechanism can benefit multimedia production companies and other entities in the MDN.",

        "Abstract": "EOSIO has become one of the most popular blockchain platforms since its mainnet launch in June 2018. In contrast to the traditional PoW-based systems (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), which are limited by low throughput, EOSIO is the first high throughput Delegated Proof of Stake system that has been widely adopted by many decentralized applications. Although EOSIO has millions of accounts and billions of transactions, little is known about its ecosystem, especially related to security and fraud. In this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement study of the EOSIO blockchain and its associated DApps. We gather a large-scale dataset of EOSIO and characterize activities including money transfers, account creation and contract invocation. Using our insights, we then develop techniques to automatically detect bots and fraudulent activity. We discover thousands of bot accounts (over 30% of the accounts in the platform) and a number of real-world attacks (301 attack accounts). By the time of our study, 80 attack accounts we identified have been confirmed by DApp teams, causing 828,824 EOS tokens losses (roughly \\$2.6 million) in total.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.",

However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations. Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities. Hopefully, this survey will provide an in-depth insight into the potential utility of blockchain in voting systems and device future research agenda.",

Despite the growing interest in using blockchain for securing IoT systems, there is a general lack of systematic research and comprehensive review of the design issues on the integration of blockchain and IoT from the software architecture perspective. This article presents a catalog of architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain as a result of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on IoT and blockchain to extract the commonly reported quality attributes, design decisions, and relevant architectural tactics for the architectural design of this category of systems. Our findings are threefold:<?brk?> (i) identification of security, scalability, performance, and interoperability as the commonly reported quality attributes; (ii) a catalog of twelve architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain; and (iii) gaps in research that include tradeoffs among quality attributes and identified tactics. These tactics might provide architects and designers with different options when searching for an optimal architectural design that meets the quality attributes of interest and constraints of a system.",

        "Abstract": "Medical image fusion generates a fused image containing multiple features extracted from different source images, and it is of great help in clinical analysis and diagnosis. However, training a deep learning model for image fusion usually requires enormous computing power, especially for large volumes of medical data. Meanwhile, the privacy of images is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based medical image fusion (BMIF) framework. First, to ensure fusion performance, we design a new medical image fusion model based on convolutional neural network and Inception network, and integrate the proposed model into the consensus process of blockchain. Next, to save computing power of blockchain, we design a consensus mechanism by requesting consensus nodes to train the fusion model instead of calculating useless hash values in traditional blockchain. Then, to protect data privacy, we further present an efficient homomorphic encryption to realize the training of fusion model on encrypted medical data. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on public datasets to evaluate the feasibility and the performance of our proposed BMIF. The results exhibit that BMIF is efficient and secure, and our medical image fusion network performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Title": "Enabling IC Traceability via Blockchain Pegged to Embedded PUF",
        "Abstract": "Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.",

        "Title": "Integration of Blockchain with Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: Vision and Challenge",
        "Abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are introduced to improve individuals\u2019 quality of life by offering a wide range of services. They collect a huge amount of data and exchange them with each other and the infrastructure. The collected data usually includes sensitive information about the users and the surrounding environment. Therefore, data security and privacy are among the main challenges in this industry. Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the \u201cdata transparency\u201d and \u201cprivacy\u201d perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1) Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2) How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?",

        "Abstract": "Recent data leak scandals, together with the under-utilization of collected data (estimated that around 90% of data never leaves a device\u2019s local storage), limits the applicability and potential of novel data driven applications. Thus, novel ways to treat data, in which users are guaranteed control, usability, and privacy over their generated data are needed. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving blockchain framework for a data sharing marketplace. The proposed framework allows users (such as sensors and devices) that generate data to store it in external servers, while the blockchain is utilized to record buy and sell transactions between parties, as well as perform access control by generating access sequences whenever trades are performed. A novel perspective over data ownership is presented, in which whoever generates the data has completed ownership and control over it and the blockchain transactions are only utilized to guarantee temporary access to it. The proposed blockchain framework also supports different types of data and provides, via the distributed and openness of the framework, quality, timeliness and similarity control over the data stored in the marketplace. In this context, different types of applications that can benefit from this framework are presented and open problems are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic systems are ubiquitous today, playing an irreplaceable role in our personal lives, as well as in critical infrastructures such as power grids, satellite communications, and public transportation. In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable \u201cby default\u201d without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.",

        "Abstract": "A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.",

Compared with conventional service architectures, cloud computing introduces new security challenges in secure service management and control, privacy protection, data integrity protection in distributed databases, data backup, and synchronization. Blockchain can be leveraged to address these challenges, partly due to the underlying characteristics such as transparency, traceability, decentralization, security, immutability, and automation. We present a comprehensive survey of how blockchain is applied to provide security services in the cloud computing model and we analyze the research trends of blockchain-related techniques in current cloud computing models. During the reviewing, we also briefly investigate how cloud computing can affect blockchain, especially about the performance improvements that cloud computing can provide for the blockchain. Our contributions include the following: (i) summarizing the possible architectures and models of the integration of blockchain and cloud computing and the roles of cloud computing in blockchain; (ii) classifying and discussing recent, relevant works based on different blockchain-based security services in the cloud computing model; (iii) simply investigating what improvements cloud computing can provide for the blockchain; (iv) introducing the current development status of the industry/major cloud providers in the direction of combining cloud and blockchain; (v) analyzing the main barriers and challenges of integrated blockchain and cloud computing systems; and (vi) providing recommendations for future research and improvement on the integration of blockchain and cloud systems.",

We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The rise of fast communication media both at the core and at the edge has resulted in unprecedented numbers of sophisticated and intelligent wireless IoT devices. Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time. Many applications such as intelligent autonomous self-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning multimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through cooperative, distributed, and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer computing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.",

        "Abstract": "Although the iterative double auction has been widely used in many different applications, one of the major problems in its current implementations is that they rely on a trusted third party to handle the auction process. This imposes the risk of single point of failures, monopoly, and bribery. In this article, we aim to tackle this problem by proposing a novel decentralized and trustless framework for iterative double auction based on blockchain. Our design adopts the smart contract and state channel technologies to enable a double auction process among parties that do not need to trust each other, while minimizing the blockchain transactions. In specific, we propose an extension to the original concept of state channels that can support multiparty computation. Then, we provide a formal development of the proposed framework and prove the security of our design against adversaries. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework using Elixir and Solidity, on which we conduct various experiments to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity in the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this paper proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called L2DART (Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.",

The design of password hashing schemes (PHSs) is in the core of blockchain security. However, no existing PHS seems to meet both the requirements of sufficient security and small code size for blockchain-based CPSs. In this article, a novel memory-hard PHS based on the classic PBKDF2 is proposed. Evaluation results show that the proposed scheme is promising for blockchain-based CPS, as it manages to provide enhanced security in comparison to PBKDF2 with limited increase in code size.",

        "Abstract": "Applying peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to online video games has already attracted both academic and industrial interests, since it removes the need for expensive server maintenance. However, there are two major issues preventing the use of a P2P architecture, namely how to provide an effective distributed data storage solution, and how to tackle potential cheating behaviors. Inspired by emerging blockchain techniques, we propose a novel consensus model called Proof-of-Play (PoP) to provide a decentralized data storage system that incorporates an anti-cheating mechanism for P2P games, by rewarding players that interact with the game as intended, along with consideration of security measures to address the Nothing-at-stake Problem and the Long-range Attack. To validate our design, we utilize a game-theory model to show that under certain assumptions, the integrity of the PoP system would not be undermined due to the best interests of any user. Then, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a P2P game (Infinity Battle) to demonstrate how a game can be integrated with PoP in practice. Finally, experiments were conducted to study PoP in comparison with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to show its advantages in various aspects.",

        "Abstract": "Security and privacy of users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem connects physical devices to the internet, offering significant advantages in agility, responsiveness and potential environmental benefits. The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralised storage and computing to operate the deep learning algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models\u2019 vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilisation of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems. It also focuses on IoT data analytics from a security perspective and the open research questions. It also provides a thorough literature review of blockchain-based FL approaches for IoT applications. Finally, the challenges and risks associated with integrating blockchain and FL in IoT are discussed to be considered in future works.",

        "Title": "SoK: DAG-based Blockchain Systems",
        "Abstract": "Limitations on high latency and low scalability of classical blockchain systems retard their adoptions and applications. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems. We abstract a general model to capture the main features and identify six types of design patterns. Then, we evaluate these systems from the perspectives of structure, consensus, property, security, and performance. We further discuss the trade-off between different factors, open challenges, and the potentiality of DAG-based solutions, indicating their promising directions for future research.",

Therefore, to improve the security of private information in medical systems, this article uses blockchain technology to design a method to protect private information in medical systems and effectively realize anti-theft control of private information. First, the Patient-oriented Privacy Preserving Access Control model is introduced into the access control process of private information in medical systems. Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.",

        "Abstract": "Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our model gains superior estimation performance.",

        "Abstract": "E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications which are related to healthcare, such as \u201cbody automation\u201d, \u201chealthcare\u201d, \u201cmedical monitoring\u201d, \u201cbody interaction\u201d and \u201cmedical implants (i.e., pacemaker)\u201d. Most of the communications happen in IoMT based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security related attacks i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a blockchain enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT based e-healthcare system which is named as \u201cBACKM-EHA\u201d in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard i.e., \u201cReal-Or-Random model\u201d. The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes as it requires less communication cost, computation cost and provides more \u201csecurity and functionality features\u201d.",

        "Abstract": "In this information age, with the emergence of organizations, the number of various resources on the Internet of Things is also increasing. Generally, different users have different access permissions to different resources and most of the existing schemes have realized access control. But most of them are rough and not feasible in many organizations. Moreover, traditional access control schemes adopted a central entity or a trusted third party to centrally manage users\u2019 permissions and access information, which can easily lead to single point of failure. Therefore, a kind of secure, trusted, and fine-grained access control is urgently needed in some large-scale organizations or institutions that maintain thousands of IoT devices. In order to solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based high-efficiency access control framework called BHE-AC to achieve secure and efficient access to resources for users. In BHE-AC, a registration model is designed to register users and resources, and it can evaluate the ability value for users according to their attributes which is an essential factor when requesting resources. Besides, we represent a blockchain-based token requesting mechanism to compare the capability values of users with requested resources; meanwhile, the mechanism also allows users to request multiple resources at the same time, which can avoid repeated requests. Then, an unforgeable token indicates the users\u2019 access to a specific resource is granted to a requester only if a requester meets the access requirements; from then on, the user can use a token to invoke the resource. Finally, security analysis and experiments of our framework are given in our paper. The experimental results show that BHE-AC can achieve low cost and efficient access.",

        "Title": "Blockchain Use-Case in Ballistics and Crime Gun Tracing and Intelligence: Towards Overcoming Gun Violence",
        "Abstract": "In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. While legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, and so on. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. This is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.",

        "Abstract": "Green Internet of things (GIoT) generally refers to a new generation of Internet of things design concept. It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform. First, based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) decentralized identifiers (DIDs) standard, users and GSD are issued visual identity (VID). Then, we extended the GSD-DIDs protocol to authenticate devices and users. Finally, based on the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of blockchain, a unified access control system for GSD was designed, including the registration, granting, and revoking of access rights. We implement and test on the Raspberry Pi device and the FISCO-BCOS alliance chain. The experimental results prove that the framework provides a unified and feasible way for users to achieve decentralized, lightweight, and fine-grained access control of GSDs. The solution reduces the complexity of accessing and controlling GSDs, enhances the scalability of GSD applications, as well as guarantees the credibility and immutability of permission data and identity data during access.",

        "Abstract": "Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple edge devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants\u2019 activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, which means a trustworthy central authority is needed which has disadvantages, including vulnerable to attacks, not always credible, and hard to calculate rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the problems mentioned above. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods as well as techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work provides a comprehensive survey on challenges, solutions, and future directions about blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes, namely decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-based Framework for Reducing Fake or Vicious News Spread on Social Media/Messaging Platforms",
        "Abstract": "With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.",

        "Abstract": "In migrating and upgrading an Ethereum smart contract, it is necessary to transfer both the code as well as the stored data. Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree (AST) and the control flow graphs (CFG) of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv\u2019s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain\u2019s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.",

        "Title": "Is my transaction done yet? An empirical study of transaction processing times in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform",
        "Abstract": "Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as \u00d0Apps. When engineering \u00d0Apps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective \u00d0Apps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., \u00d0App developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan\u2019s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation\u2019s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, \u00d0App developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.",

The research should be based on the possibility of quick access to information, interactivity and interaction of participants in search for information, elimination of temporal and spatial obstacles. Everything mentioned above requires the use of new research technologies, including blockchain technology. This technology allows solving the problems of collection and systematization of scientific data, access to it within the framework of project operation and implementation at any organization, and joint efforts of various structures. Data saved in blocks and stored on different servers can be accessed by different users. It reduces the cost of coordinating the actions of different users who want to obtain certain information.

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology provides efficient and secure solutions to various online activities by utilizing a wide range of cryptographic tools. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on post-quantum secure digital signatures that possess exotic advanced features and which are crucial cryptographic tools used in the blockchain ecosystem for (i) account management, (ii) consensus efficiency, (iii) empowering scriptless blockchain, and (iv) privacy. The exotic signatures that we particularly focus on in this work are the following: multi-/aggregate, threshold, adaptor, blind and ring signatures. Herein the term exotic refers to signatures with properties which are not just beyond the norm for signatures e.g. unforgeability, but also imbue new forms of functionalities. Our treatment of such exotic signatures includes discussions on existing challenges and future research directions in the post-quantum space. We hope that this article will help to foster further research to make post-quantum cryptography more accessible so that blockchain systems can be made ready in advance of the approaching quantum threats.",

These complex technologies rely on human and technical factors to deliver cryptocurrencies, shared computation and trustless protocols but have a secondary benefit in providing a moment to re-think many aspects of society, and imagine alternative possibilities. The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging publics, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology. This paints a comprehensive picture of how HCI and design can shape understandings of the future of complex technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains, in general, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in particular, are realized using distributed systems and hence critically rely on the performance and security of the interconnecting network. The requirements on these networks and their usage, however, can differ significantly from traditional communication networks, with implications on all layers of the protocol stack. This article is motivated by these differences and, in particular, by the observation that many fundamental design aspects of these networks are not well-understood today. To support the networking community to contribute to this emerging application domain, we present a structured overview of the field, from topology and neighbor discovery, over block and transaction propagation, to sharding and off-chain networks, also reviewing existing empirical results from different measurement studies. In particular, for each of these domains, we provide the context, highlighting differences and commonalities with traditional networks, review the state-of-the-art, and identify open research challenges. Our article can hence also be seen as a call-to-arms to improve the foundation on top of which blockchains are built.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of hybrid blockchain database systems, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the performance and trade-offs among a few representative systems. To achieve this goal, we implement Veritas and BlockchainDB from scratch. For Veritas, we provide two flavors to target the crash fault-tolerant (CFT) and Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) application scenarios. Specifically, we implement Veritas with Apache Kafka to target CFT application scenarios, and Veritas with Tendermint to target BFT application scenarios. We compare these three systems with the existing open-source implementation of BigchainDB. BigchainDB uses Tender-mint for consensus and provides two flavors: a default implementation with blockchain pipelining and an optimized version that includes blockchain pipelining and parallel transaction validation. Our experimental analysis confirms that CFT designs, which are typically used by distributed databases, exhibit much higher performance than BFT designs, which are specific to blockchains. On the other hand, our extensive analysis highlights the variety of design choices faced by the developers and sheds some light on the trade-offs that need to be done when designing a hybrid blockchain database system.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasing prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply-chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanism to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain paradigm provides a mechanism for content dissemination and distributed consensus on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. While this paradigm has been widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of its network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for blockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of network scaling. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain system. We identify a structural property called one-endedness, which we show to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to distributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of the network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further establish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone separable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the stability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P network through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of blockchain systems on large P2P networks. We verify our theoretical insights using both synthetic data and real data from the Bitcoin network.",

        "Abstract": "Unprecedented attention towards blockchain technology is serving as a game-changer in fostering the development of blockchain-enabled distinctive frameworks. However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI\u2019s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains. Furthermore, this article proposes an in-depth BI research taxonomy and provides an insight into the state-of-the-art projects. Finally, it determines possible open challenges and future research in the domain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.",

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus.",

        "Title": "Secure IoMT Pattern Recognition and Exploitation for Multimedia Information Processing using Private Blockchain and Fuzzy Logic",
        "Abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a definite IoT connecting atmosphere that contracts with communication via intelligent medical equipment. Activity detection, motion tracking, information extraction, consumer retrieval, etc., have all been solved due to advances in the autonomous study of human behavior from multimedia information processing. Though the IoT connecting atmosphere enables and provisions our daily actions, it too has certain disadvantages. IoTgrieves from numerous safety and confidentiality challenges, such as reiteration, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, remote hijacking, privileged-insider attack, denial of service (DoS) attacks, password guessing, and malware bouts. Hence, in this paper, Private Blockchain and Fuzzy Logic based Attack Detection system (PBFL-ADS) has been proposed for secure IoMT disease prediction using Multimedia Information Processing techniques. The proposed method utilizes Bayesian inference-based trust administration to perceived malevolent nodes in Health Smartphone Structures (HSS) for PBFL-ADS. This paper focuses on the specific form of IoMT called HSS because smartphones have been widely used in the healthcare profession. Then, blockchains have been utilized to improve Bayesian trust management's efficacy in detecting hostile nodes in HSSs. The effectiveness of the suggested technique has been assessed, and test results show that blockchain technology helps identify fraudulent nodes with an acceptable workload. The proposed PBFL-ADS method increases the HS2 scenario 1.1, processor utilization at nodes 33.5%, pattern recognition ratio 92.1%.and server utilization 40.1%.",

        "Title": "Transparent Registration-based Encryption through Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Garg et al. (TCC 2018) defined the notion of registration-based encryption (RBE) where the private key generator (PKG) is decoupled from key management and replaced by a key curator (KC). KC does not possess any cryptographic secrets and only plays the role of aggregating the public keys of all the registered users and updating the public parameters whenever a new user joins the system, which solves the key escrow issue. Notwithstanding, RBE still places a significant amount of trust in KC, whose actions are not accountable, e.g., it could secretly register multiple keys for already registered users. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based RBE framework, which provides total transparency and decentralization of KC by leveraging smart contracts. Our framework transfers the right of key management from KC to individual participants and keeps publicly upgradeable parameters on-chain. We provide a basic construction that calculates the public parameter on-chain and an extended construction with better efficiency, which merely calculates the roots of trees on-chain. Our basic version is theoretically feasible, while the extended version is practically feasible. In particular, the enhanced scheme reduces computing complexity to a constant level. Our prototype implementation and evaluation results demonstrate that our extended construction is satisfactorily efficient.",

        "Abstract": "In blockchain networks, reaching effective supervision while maintaining anonymity to the public has been an ongoing challenge. In existing solutions, certification authorities need to record all pairs of identities and pseudonyms, which is demanding and costly. This article proposed an account guarantee scheme to realize feasible supervision for existing anonymous blockchain networks with lower storage costs. Users are able to guarantee anonymous accounts with account guarantee key pairs generated from certificated polynomial functions, which inherently maintains one-to-n mapping certifications. Single or limited account guarantee key pairs do not leak privacy. Victims are able to request TCs to screen a cheater or disclose a cheater with enough fraud transactions by themselves. Detailed security and privacy analysis showed that the account guarantee scheme preserves user privacy and realizes feasible supervision. Experimental results demonstrated that the account guarantee scheme is efficient and practical.",

        "Abstract": "The advances of Internet technology has resulted in the rapid and pervasive development of e-commerce, which has not only changed the production and operation mode of many enterprises, but also affected the economic development mode of the whole society. This trend has incurred a strong need to store and process large amounts of sensitive data. The traditional data storage and search solutions cannot meet such requirements. To tackle this problem, in this article, we proposed Consortium Blockchain-based Distributed Secure Search (CBDSS) Scheme over encrypted data in e-Commerce environment. By integrating the blockchain and searchable encryption model, sensitive data can be effectively protected. The consortium blockchain can ensure that only authorized nodes can join the system. To fairly assign nodes for the search tasks, we developed an endorsement strategy in which two agent roles are set up to divide and match the search tasks with the virtual resources according to the load capacity of each node. The security analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme. The evaluation results have proved the reliability and security of our scheme over existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology provides a secure and reliable platform for managing data in various application areas, such as supply chain management, multimedia, financial sector, food sector, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and many more. The recent emergence of blockchain with IoT provides significant growth in the healthcare industry to improve security, privacy, efficiency, and transparency with more business opportunities. Nevertheless, conventional healthcare schemes suffer from various security attacks like collusion, phishing, masquerade, etc. Therefore, a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) is proposed in this paper using blockchain technology to create and maintain healthcare certificates. Here, the distributed application provides an interface between the blockchain network and system objects like healthcare centers, verifiers, and regular authorities to generate and issue medical documents. In addition, it also ensures security by specifying rules using various smart contracts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, various experimental tests are conducted using the Etherscan tool for measuring operation cost, latency, and processing time. Here, the efficiency of the proposed system is also compared to the existing systems in terms of latency, throughput, and response time. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that the proposed work is more efficient than the existing techniques.",

In presenting suggestions for using blockchain as a tool to teach core computer science concepts, the authors reflect on student-centered, research-based projects spent understanding blockchain and developing an elementary implementation. Their experiences led to several teachable moments applicable to many topics across CS curricula including software design, algorithms and data structures, and distributed computing. The authors discuss many definitions of blockchain filtered through the philosophical lens of essence and accidents, give a precise definition of \"essential\" blockchain, and provide insight to understanding blockchain by presenting several of its structures and their implementation in the context of those curricular topics.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has evolved from a hype to a technical reality and is quickly becoming a demanded skill. Career-oriented colleges are facing the challenge to incorporate blockchain technology into existing curriculum. While lacking instructional and curriculum models, educators must (a) identify the knowledge domains of blockchain technology, (b) classify their topical areas, and (c) place them in suitable academic subjects (programming, management, or business laws), before being able to determine the appropriate level of instructions and pedagogies. This paper describes a model designed and used to evaluate what topical areas of blockchain technology are practical to teach at a career-oriented college. The evaluation is based on seven factors: (1) maturity of technology, (2) impacts on management, (3) real-world applications, (4) subject classification, (5) knowledge prerequisites, (6) textbook readiness, and (7) recommended pedagogies. The evaluation results are presented by a rating scale ranging from 1 to 5 indicating the degree of \"appropriateness\" of instruction at college level. A set of territorial indicators also help to clarify the subject territory (computer science, business, or law). This paper suggests to: (1) offer all majors with an introductory course for students to understand what blockchain is and how it applies to business, (2) teach a cryptocurrency-centered course that engages students of technical majors with in-depth discussion of sciences and technologies that drive blockchain, and, if instructionally feasible, (3) guide CS and CIS majors through a project-based programming course for experiencing how to code blockchain applications.",

        "Abstract": "Pervasive Social Networking (PSN) supports online and instant social activities with the support of heterogeneous networks. Since reciprocal activities among both familiar/unfamiliar strangers and acquaintances are quite common in PSN, it is essential to offer trust information to PSN users. Past work normally evaluates trust based on a centralized party, which is not feasible due to the dynamic changes of PSN topology and its specific characteristics. The literature still lacks a decentralized trust evaluation scheme in PSN. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized system for trust evaluation in PSN, called Social-Chain. Considering mobile devices normally lack computing resources to process cryptographic puzzle calculation, we design a lightweight consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Trust (PoT), which remarkably improves system effectivity compared with other blockchain systems. Serious security analysis and experimental results further illustrate the security and efficiency of Social-Chain for being feasibly applied into PSN.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world with rapid development and implementations to change our everyday lives based on smart devices. These devices are attached to the internet that can communicate with each other without human interference. A well-known wireless network in blockchain-enabled IoT frameworks is the Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) that uses a novel protocol known as Routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) to provide effective and energy-efficient routing. LLNs that run on RPL are inherently prone to multiple Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the low cost, shared medium and resource-constrained nature of blockchain-enabled IoT devices. A Spam DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack is one of the novel attacks that drain the energy source of legitimate nodes and ends up causing the legitimate nodes to suffer from DoS. To address this problem, a mitigation scheme named DIS Spam Attack Mitigation (DISAM) is proposed. The proposed scheme effectively mitigates the effects of the Spam DIS attack on the network\u2019s performance. The experimental results show that DISAM detects and mitigates the attack quickly and efficiently.",

        "Title": "RTChain: A Reputation System with Transaction and Consensus Incentives for E-commerce Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology, whose most successful application is Bitcoin, enables non-repudiation and non-tamperable online transactions without the participation of a trusted central party. As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain\u2019s throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic distributed network has been formed among IoT devices. There is an extreme need to establish a trust mechanism between devices, and blockchain can provide a zero-trust security framework for IoT. However, the efficiency of the blockchain is far from meeting the application requirements of the IoT, which has become the biggest resistance to the application of the blockchain in the IoT. Therefore, this paper combines sharding to build an effective Blockchain-based IoT data storage scheme (S-BDS). Sharding can solve the problem of blockchain capacity and scalability. While the blockchain provides data immutability and traceability for the IoT, it also brings huge demand for data credibility verification. The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated. IVC can effectively reduce communication congestion and improve the stability and security of the IoT system.",

However, how to effectively share sensor data without compromising confidentiality, privacy protection, and fair trading without third parties is one of critical issues that must be solved in the SaaS in smart cities. While blockchain shows promise in solving these issues, the existing blockchain-based data sharing (BBDS) systems are difficult to apply to SaaS in smart cities because of many unresolved issues such as requiring a customized blockchain, huge storage, communication and computation costs, and dependence on a third party to achieve fair trading. We propose a BBDS system model with its security requirements before we present a concrete construction by combining\n-protocol, Paillier encryption scheme, and any secure symmetrical encryption and signature schemes. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed BBDS system, we present a security analysis and compare our system with other solutions. We implement the prototype in Remix to analyze the gas cost, and we conduct experiments to evaluate the communication and computation costs of the BBDS system using symmetric encryption (advanced encryption standard (AES)) and a signature scheme (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)).",

We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.",

The main underlying data structure is blockchain, a scalable fully replicated structure that is shared among all participants and guarantees a consistent view of all user transactions by all participants in the cryptocurrency system. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we expound on some of the most recent proposals to design scalable and efficient blockchains. The focus of the tutorial is on the distributed systems and database technical aspects of the recent innovations in blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "Different malicious activities occur in cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Some activities are due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities which are present in the blockchain infrastructure, some activities target its users through social engineering techniques, while some activities use it to facilitate different malicious activities. Since cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide pseudonymity to its users, bad actors prefer to carry out transactions related to malicious activities on them. Towards this, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts as suspects that indulge in malicious activities, thus reducing the unintended support that cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide to malicious actors. We first use the cosine similarity (CS) metrics to study the similarities between the feature vector of accounts associated with different malicious activities and find that most of the malicious activities associated with the Ethereum blockchain behave similarly. We then use the K-Means clustering algorithm to check if accounts associated with similar malicious activities cluster together. We also study the effect of bias on the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, due to the number of accounts associated with malicious activity. We then compare the different state-of-the-art models and identify that Neural Networks (NNs) are resistant to bias associated with a malicious activity and are also robust against adversarial attacks. The previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts also show bias towards an over-represented malicious activity.",

        "Abstract": "The success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is drawing significant interest to blockchains. A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures the entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing. In this paper, we identify a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. We first motivate the need for adding native provenance support to blockchains. We then present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes lineage information to smart contracts runtime via simple and elegant interfaces that efficiently and securely support provenance-dependent contracts. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution and stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for efficient provenance queries. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Fabric and a blockchain optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its high query performance and its small storage overhead.",

        "Abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even the leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve the cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers the off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. However, transaction failures may occur due to external attacks or unexpected conditions, e.g., an uncooperative user becoming unresponsive. In this paper, we present a distributed robust payment routing protocol <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RobustPay^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to resist transaction failures, which achieves robustness, efficiency, distributedness and approximate optimization. Specifically, we investigate the problem of robust routing in PCNs from an optimization perspective, which is to find a pair of payment paths for a payment request, while minimizing the worst-case transaction fee, subject to the timeliness and feasibility constraints. We present a distributed 2-approximation algorithm for this problem. Moreover, we modify the original Hashed Time-lock Contract (HTLC) protocol and adapt it to the robust payment routing protocol to achieve robustness and efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RobustPay^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of the success ratio and the average accepted value",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles(IoV) enables vehicles to generate and share messages to improve transportation safety and efficiency, especially in a smart city scenario where modern communication technology is utilized. The current IoV, however, faces three main issues: (1) existing frameworks fail to build a complete data management system, (2) received messages in an untrusted environment are challenging to assess for credibility, and (3) the centralized ways to store data are causing severe security and efficiency problems. Blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV) provides an opportunity for addressing these issues. This paper proposes a trusted paradigm of data management based on a vehicle\u2013road\u2013cloud architecture. A few-shot learning model, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling is designed to evaluate whether the uploading message is malicious. This paper also proposes the novel group-weighted-decay Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, an improved version of PBFT to store data, and provides a comprehensive review of its viability and data management procedures. By employing the joint gwd-PBFT and Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus, the method mitigates the issue of excessive incentives. According to simulation results, the system's overall efficiency can be increased while retaining security and availability.",

        "Abstract": "The digital transformation of the medical sector requires solutions that are convenient and efficient for all stakeholders while protecting patients\u2019 sensitive data. One example that has already attracted design-oriented research are medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic prescription management systems typically create centralized data silos, leaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding interoperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on blockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored. We conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the exchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a digital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized double-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing approaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control over their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and scalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management solutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on how to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require both the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain platforms are coming into use for processing critical transactions among participants who have not established mutual trust. Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian\u2019s applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian\u2019s type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this work statically.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) has become the backbone of innumerable multimedia applications in various fields. The wide application of IoMT not only makes our life convenient but also brings challenges to service discovery. Service discovery aims to leverage location information and trust evidence scattered in a variety of multimedia applications to find trusted IoMT devices that can provide specific service in target areas. However, the eavesdropping and tampering to these sensitive IoMT data during the trust propagation process invalidate the service discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose Secure Service Discovery (SSD) for IoMT using cross-blockchain-enabled fog computing. To resist the tampering and eavesdropping during the trust propagation process, a scalable cross-blockchain structure consisting of multiple parallel blockchains is first proposed based on fog, in which different parallel blockchains can be orchestrated to propagate encrypted location information and trust evidence of different applications. Moreover, to enable a cross-blockchain structure to leverage encrypted location information and trust evidence to find trusted IoMT devices in preset areas, a novel privacy-preserving range query is proposed to query and aggregate trust evidence. Security analysis and simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the proposed SSD.",

These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters untrusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are a key component of today\u2019s blockchains. They are critical in controlling decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). However, smart contracts are not yet legally binding nor enforceable; this makes it difficult for businesses to adopt the DAO paradigm. Therefore, this study reviews existing Smart Contract Languages (SCL) and identifies properties that are critical to any future SCL for drafting legally binding contracts. This is achieved by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of white- and grey literature published between 2015 and 2019. Using the SLR methodology, 45 Selected and 28 Supporting Studies detailing 45 state-of-the-art SCLs are selected. Finally, 10 SCL properties that enable legally compliant DAOs are discovered, and specifications for developing SCLs are explored.",

We present ethnographic data unpacking three different accounts of infrastructural grind taking place at the intersection of the shipping and the Blockchain information infrastructures. The results demonstrate that infrastructural grind occurs as a result of various infrastructuring activities taking place at different intersections between the two infrastructures and is constituted of the sum of these activities. We propose a framework in which infrastructural grind is constituted of three entangled dimensions: permeability, interoperability, and velocity. These socio-technical dimensions relate to infrastructural properties such as legacy, embeddedness, and standards, as well as to technical properties of specific solutions deployed at specific points of infrastructural grind. Our analysis shows that these dimensions are enacted differently along the shipping supply chain, and depending on the dynamic interplay between them at various points of infrastructural grind.

        "Abstract": "At present, clients can outsource lots of complex and abundant computation, e.g., Internet of things (IoT), tasks to clouds by the \u201cpay as you go\u201d model. Outsourcing computation can save costs for clients and fully utilize the existing cloud infrastructures. However, it is hard for clients to trust the clouds even if blockchain is used as the trusted platform. In this article, we utilize the verification method as SETI@home by only two rational clouds, who hope to maximize their utilities. Utilities are defined as the incomes of clouds when they provide computation results to clients. More specifically, one client outsources two jobs to two clouds and each job contains n tasks, which include k identical sentinels. Two clouds can either honestly compute each task or collude on the identical sentinel tasks by agreeing on random values. If the results of identical sentinels are identical, then client regards the jobs as correctly computed without verification. Obviously, rational clouds have incentives to deviate by collusion and provide identical random results for a higher income. We discuss how to prevent collusion by using deposits, e.g., bit-coins. Furthermore, utilities for each cloud can be automatically assigned by a smart contract. We prove that, given proper parameters, two rational clouds will honestly send correct results to the client without collusion.",

All blockchains achieve a common goal: building a decentralized system that provides a trustworthy service in an untrustworthy environment. A blockchain builds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) system in which decentralized nodes run a protocol to reach an agreement on the common system state. In this article, we focus on the research of BFT protocols. In particular, we categorize BFT protocols according to both the system models and workflow. We seek to answer these important questions: How has the research in BFT evolved in the past four decades, especially with the rise of blockchains? What are the driven needs for BFT research in the future?",

Blockchain has evolved to become a generic approach to store and process data in a highly decentralized and secure way. In this article, we review blockchain concepts and use cases, and discuss the challenges in using them from a governmental viewpoint. We begin with reviewing the categories of blockchains, the underlying mechanisms, and why blockchains can achieve their security goals. We then review existing known governmental use cases by regions. To show both technical and deployment details of blockchain adoption, we study a few representative use cases in the domains of healthcare and energy infrastructures. Finally, the review of both technical details and use cases helps us summarize the adoption and technical challenges of blockchains.",

Service providers have provided more diverse and extensive information services. With the recent evolution to a customized service, the demand for the use of personal information is increasing. However, it affects the efficiency and convenience of service provision, as social problems and security threats such as personal information leakage, human trafficking, and misuse increase. In this article, we proposed an intelligent mediator-based enhanced smart contract for privacy protection. The proposed approach performs the tasks, which are mediation transactions, authorization, and transaction record management, with blockchain-based personal information management. Then it is possible to prevent misuse of personal information and to support rational decision-making on the transparency of information and the use of personal information by autonomously performing personal information management.",

        "Abstract": "Korean education-related evaluation agencies utilize a centralized system that directly manages learner data. This leaves the intellectual property of the organizations and the personal information of the students vulnerable to leakage should the central server be attacked. In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data. This system provides a platform to share learner information safely and promptly among schools, certification authorities, and higher learning institutions.",

To facilitate the selection of suitable DLT designs, we review DLT characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how DLT designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for DLT designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on DLT. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of DLT designs and to support development of viable applications on DLT.",

        "Title": "Tuxedo: Maximizing Smart Contract Computation in PoW Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (\u03c4) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large \u03c4 also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale \u03c4/I \u22481 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to \u03b6 blocks, where \u03b6 is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay \u0394 and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale \u03c4 without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of \u03c4/I in existing blockchains",

        "Abstract": "While permissioned blockchains enable a family of data center applications, existing systems suffer from imbalanced loads across compute and memory, exacerbating the underutilization of cloud resources. This paper presents FlexChain, a novel permissioned blockchain system that addresses this challenge by physically disaggregating CPUs, DRAM, and storage devices to process different blockchain workloads efficiently. Disaggregation allows blockchain service providers to upgrade and expand hardware resources independently to support a wide range of smart contracts with diverse CPU and memory demands. Moreover, it ensures efficient resource utilization and hence prevents resource fragmentation in a data center. We have explored the design of XOV blockchain systems in a disaggregated fashion and developed a tiered key-value store that can elastically scale its memory and storage. Our design significantly speeds up the execution stage. We have also leveraged several techniques to parallelize the validation stage in FlexChain to further improve the overall blockchain performance. Our evaluation results show that FlexChain can provide independent compute and memory scalability, while incurring at most 12.8% disaggregation overhead. FlexChain achieves almost identical throughput as the state-of-the-art distributed approaches with significantly lower memory and CPU consumption for compute-intensive and memory-intensive workloads respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, most of the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructures are highly centralized with single points of failure, which results in serious security and privacy issues of IoT data. Fortunately, blockchain technique can provide a decentralized and secure IoT framework to deal with security issues based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency and traceability. However, the blockchain consensus protocol guarantees the safety and reliability of data, but it also brings problems such as scalability limitations and poor storage extensibility, resulting in the inability to directly integrate blockchain and the IoT in existing conditions. In this paper, a private three-tier local blockchain, Three-tier architecture Blockchain (TBchain), is proposed to solve the problem by splitting part of the transactions in the public blockchain and locking them in a higher-level blockchain TBchain. Additionally, the private blockchain TBchain is connected to the public blockchain to build a hierarchical blockchain network to provide privacy protection for the IoT data stored on the blockchain. Finally, we implement an IoT framework based on TBchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to realize the decentralized IoT, which guarantees the user\u2019s access control right to personal data. Experimental results show that the IoT framework based on TBchain and IPFS realizes the user\u2019s access control right to personal data by verifying in advance to ensure the confidentiality and security of shared data, and improves the security and privacy of IoT data and transactions. Moreover, we prove that the scalability and storage extensibility of the blockchain is positively correlated with the number of data blocks in TBchain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing\u2014Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.",

The ordering consensus can be the bottleneck since it must be Byzantine-fault tolerant and can scarcely benefit from parallel execution. In this paper, we propose an ordering-free architecture that makes ordering implicit through deterministic execution. Based on this novel architecture, we develop a permissioned blockchain system NeuChain. A number of key optimizations such as asynchronous block generation and pipelining are leveraged for high throughput and low latency. Several security mechanisms are also designed to make our system robust to malicious attacks. Our geo-distributed experimental results show that NeuChain can achieve 47.2--64.1X throughput improvement over HyperLedger Fabric and 1.6--12.2X throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art high performance blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains are distributed secure ledgers to which transactions are issued continuously and each block of transactions is tightly coupled to its predecessors. Permissioned blockchains place special emphasis on transactions throughput. In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative nature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic execution scenarios. FireLedger trades latency for throughput in the sense that in FireLedger the last f + 1 blocks of each node's blockchain are considered tentative, i.e., they may be rescinded in case one of the last f + 1 blocks proposers was Byzantine. Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block is decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends only its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each. In our performance study FireLedger obtained 20% -- 600% better throughput than state of the art protocols like HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt, depending on the configuration.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual\u2019s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant\u2019s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain\u2019s challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant\u2019s privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants.",

        "Title": "Smart Contract Languages: A Multivocal Mapping Study",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 4,119 papers were gathered, and 109 of them were selected for extraction. The contributions of this article are twofold: (1) 101 different smart contract languages have been identified and classified according to a variety of criteria; (2) a discussion on the findings and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview of the state-of-the-art of smart contract languages has been provided that can benefit not only researchers but also practitioners in the field, thanks to its multivocal nature.",

        "Abstract": "Malware detection approaches have been extensively studied for traditional software systems. However, the development of blockchain technology has promoted the birth of a new type of software system\u2013decentralized applications. Composed of smart contracts, a type of application that implements the Ponzi scheme logic (called smart Ponzi schemes) has caused irreversible loss and hindered the development of blockchain technology. These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas). The experiment results show that MulCas can achieve higher performance and robustness in the scope of our dataset. Most importantly, the proposed method can identify smart Ponzi scheme at the creation time.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains store transaction data in the form of a distributed ledger where each node in the network stores a current copy of the sequence of transactions as a hash chain. This requirement of storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks. In this work we use secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to design a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of each transaction, thereby reducing the cold storage cost to a fraction of its original cost. In addition, the storage code ensures the security of the storage from active adversaries that may aim to corrupt prior transactions by altering copies of the ledger. We further employ a dynamic zone allocation algorithm that spreads the node allocation and data distribution across transactions. Under this coding scheme we show that we can also improve the integrity of the transaction data in the network over current schemes.",

Contracts in SigVM can emit signal events, on which other contracts can listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler functions are automatically executed as signal transactions. We build an end-to-end blockchain platform SigChain and a contract language compiler SigSolid to realize the potential of SigVM. Experimental results show that our benchmark applications can be reimplemented with SigVM in a truly decentralized way, eliminating the dependency on centralized and unreliable mechanisms like off-chain relay servers. The development effort of reimplementing these contracts with SigVM is small, i.e., we modified on average 3.17% of the contract code. The runtime and the gas overhead of SigVM on these contracts is negligible.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to off-chain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97% ~ 99%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4\u00d7 ~ 15.6\u00d7.",

Most existing research focuses on pinpointing specific types of vulnerabilities using known patterns. However, due to the lack of awareness of the inherent nondeterminism in the Ethereum blockchain system and how it affects the funds transfer of smart contracts, there can be unknown vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers to access numerous online smart contracts.",

        "Abstract": "The rise of programmable open distributed consensus platforms based on the blockchain technology has aroused a lot of interest in replicated stateful computations, aka smart contracts. As blockchains are used predominantly in financial applications, smart contracts frequently manage millions of dollars worth of virtual coins. Since smart contracts cannot be updated once deployed, the ability to reason about their correctness becomes a critical task. Yet, the de facto implementation standard, pioneered by the Ethereum platform, dictates smart contracts to be deployed in a low-level language, which renders independent audit and formal verification of deployed code infeasible in practice.",

        "Abstract": "Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial.",

        "Abstract": "As cryptographic tokens and altcoins are increasingly being built to serve as utility tokens, the notion of useful work consensus protocols is becoming ever more important. With useful work consensus protocols, users get rewards after they have carried out some specific tasks useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be provided, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify reliably. To deal with such cases, we design \u201cProof-of-Prestige\u201d (PoP)\u2014a reward system that can run directly on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains or as a smart contract on top of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. PoP introduces \u201cprestige,\u201d which is a volatile resource that, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services, and directly translates to users minting power. Our scheme allows us to reliably reward decentralized workers while keeping the system free for the end-users. PoP is resistant against Sybil and collusion attacks and can be used with a vast range of unverifiable tasks. We build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behavior of the system and deploy a full prototype of a content dissemination platform rewarding its participants. We implement the blockchain component on both Ethereum (PoW) and Cosmos (PoS), provide a mobile application, and connect it with our scheme with a negligible memory footprint. Finally, we adapt a fair exchange protocol allowing us to atomically exchange files for rewards also in scenarios where not all the parties have Internet connectivity. Our evaluation shows that even for large Ethereum traces, PoP introduces sub-millisecond computational overhead for miners in Cosmos and less than 0.013$ smart contract invocation cost for users in Ethereum.",

        "Abstract": "Connected vehicles are set to define the future of transportation; however, this upcoming technology continues to be plagued with serious security risks. If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph\u2013based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy. The standard deviation of error measurements for nodes experiencing tampering attack is around 60% higher as compared to nodes that do not experience such an attack.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication platform provides seamless information exchange facilities in a dynamic mobile city environment. Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This paper proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication respectively. In this process, frequent chance in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded with the knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens so as to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using appropriate simulations for the above discussed metrics by varying the vehicles density, error rate, and classification sets.",

Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed \u201ctransactional sensitivity\u201d) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process.

        "Title": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance For Distributed Ledgers Revisited",
        "Abstract": "The problem of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has received a lot of attention in the last 30 years. Due to the popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains in recent years, several BFT protocols have been deployed in the large scale of Internet environment. We analyze several popular BFT protocols such as Capser FFG/CBC-FBC for Ethereum 2.0 and GRANDPA for Polkadot. Our analysis shows that the security models for these BFT protocols are slightly different from the models commonly accepted in the academic literature. For example, we show that, if the adversary has a full control of the message delivery order in the underlying network, then none of the BFT protocols for Ethereum blockchain 2.0 and Polkadot blockchain could achieve liveness even in a synchronized network. Though it is not clear whether a practical adversary could actually control and re-order the underlying message delivery system (at Internet scale) to mount these attacks, it raises an interesting question on security model gaps between academic BFT protocols and deployed BFT protocols in the Internet scale. With these analysis, this article proposes a Casper CBC-FBC style binary BFT protocol and shows its security in the traditional academic security model with complete asynchronous networks. For partial synchronous networks, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol BDLS based on the seminal DLS protocol and show that it is one of the most efficient practical BFT protocols at large scale networks in the traditional academic BFT security model. The implementation of BDLS is available at https://github.com/yonggewang/bdls. Finally, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol XP for complete asynchronous networks and show its security in the traditional academic BFT security model.",

        "Title": "Proof-of-Stake in Algorand",
        "Abstract": "In the last few years, a number of blockchain-based online platforms decided to use consensus procedures other than Proof of Work (PoW), originally adopted by Bitcoin. An alternative protocol, which attracted much attention, is the so-called Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which unlike PoW consensus is not based on solving an energy-consuming cryptopuzzle, but rather on the amount of currency units owned by a user. Different platforms adopted alternative versions of PoS. In this article, we investigate a version of PoS inspired by Algorand, which embodies a number of specific features. Indeed, to confirm a new block in the chain Algorand introduces three steps: proposal, selection, and confirmation of a block. Each step is performed by randomly selected users, where draws are based on PoS. We find explicit solutions for individual money demand, under the main simplifying assumption that a user is rewarded by the system only for the first role that she's drawn for. We do so by considering both exogenous and endogenous money supply. We also discuss the monetary equilibrium of the system, an important element in the analysis because a long-lasting disequilibrium of the economy may cause disappointment and induce some users to leave the system. Our findings suggest that an equilibrium seems to be more likely to take place if users have heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, preferences.",

        "Title": "Atomic commitment across blockchains",
        "Abstract": "The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless networks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction protocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure, denial of service attacks or even network delays might end up losing assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart contracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open permissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting events could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an atomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",

        "Abstract": "SMEs in China always face financing constraints and hardly obtain bank loans under unsound financing system due to the information asymmetry, while thousands of SMEs have contributed greatly to Chinese economic development in the last decades. Credit reporting has been verified to be an effective way to lower information asymmetry. However, existed credit reporting systems for SMEs can not meet the development of SMEs and provide enough information to the financial institutions in China. This paper introduces an active and dynamic credit reporting framework based on Big data and Blockchain for SMEs. The framework is composed of five modules, including credit data acquisition, authentication, evaluation, reporting, and interaction. And it features in capturing diversified data online, conducting evaluation and analysis in real time, generating online credit reports for users automatically, and providing an effective way for different entities to interact. A case study from a real credit evaluation company is also proposed finally to show the proposed framework.",

        "Title": "Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Routing Cryptocurrency over Payment Channel Networks",
        "Abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are viewed as one of the most promising scalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. In deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when routing transactions, users typically first guess a path, then check if it supports the transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give substantial improvements in transaction success rate at the expense of privacy. In this work, we ask whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy by sacrificing a little utility.",

        "Abstract": "As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general automated market maker (AMM) framework describing the economics and formalizing the system\u2019s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top automated market maker (AMM) protocols\u2019 mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs)\u2019 inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both decentralized finance (DeFi) and conventional market microstructure.",

A transaction ordering scheme is also presented to enforce only the necessary and sufficient constraints on transaction order to guarantee data consistency. Furthermore, Qanaat supports data consistency across collaboration workflows where an enterprise can participate in different collaboration workflows with different sets of enterprises.

        "Abstract": "Outsourcing helps relocate data from the cyber-physical system (CPS) for efficient storage at low cost. Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS). As implementations, we instantiate how to use our proposals to outsource small- or large-scale data through distinct CPS, respectively. Additionally, a blockchain with proof-of-discrete-logarithm (B-PoDL) is instantiated to help improve our performance. Last, as demonstrated by our evaluations, our proposals are secure, efficient, and economic for users to implement while outsourcing their data via CPSs.",

One of the biggest challenges facing the clinical trial research community is satisfying Part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [7] and ISO 27789 [40]. These controls provide audit requirements that guarantee the reliability of the data contained in the electronic records. Context-aware smart devices and wearable IoT devices have become increasingly common in clinical trials. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) do not currently address the new challenges introduced using these devices. The healthcare digital threat landscape is continually evolving, and the prevalence of sensor fusion and wearable devices compounds the growing attack surface. We propose Scrybe, a permissioned blockchain, to store proof of clinical trial data provenance. We illustrate how Scrybe addresses each control and the limitations of the Ethereum-based blockchains. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept integration with REDCap to show tamper resistance.",

        "Abstract": "We demonstrate SChain, a consortium blockchain that scales transaction processing to support large-scale enterprise applications. The unique advantage of SChain stems from the exploitation of both intra- and inter-block concurrency. The intra-block concurrency not only takes advantage of the multi-core processor on a single peer but also leverages the capacity of multiple peers. The interblock concurrency enables simultaneous processing across multiple blocks to increase the utilization of various peers. In our demonstration, we use real-time dashboards containing visualization based on the output of SChain to give the attendees interactive explorations of how SChain achieves intra- and inter-block concurrency.",

        "Title": "Refiner: a reliable incentive-driven federated learning system powered by blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Modern mobile applications often produce decentralized data, i.e., a huge amount of privacy-sensitive data distributed over a large number of mobile devices. Techniques for learning models from decentralized data must properly handle two natures of such data, namely privacy and massive engagement. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for such a learning task since the technique learns models from data without exposing privacy. However, traditional FL methods assume that the participating mobile devices are honest volunteers. This assumption makes traditional FL methods unsuitable for applications where two kinds of participants are engaged: 1) self-interested participants who, without economical stimulus, are reluctant to contribute their computing resources unconditionally, and 2) malicious participants who send corrupt updates to disrupt the learning process. This paper proposes Refiner, a reliable federated learning system for tackling the challenges introduced by massive engagements of self-interested and malicious participants. Refiner is built upon Ethereum, a public blockchain platform. To engage self-interested participants, we introduce an incentive mechanism which rewards each participant in terms of the amount of its training data and the performance of its local updates. To handle malicious participants, we propose an audit scheme which employs a committee of randomly chosen validators for punishing them with no reward and preclude corrupt updates from the global model. The proposed incentive and audit scheme is implemented with cryptocurrency and smart contract, two primitives offered by Ethereum. This paper demonstrates the main features of Refiner by training a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset.",

They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.",

        "Abstract": "Some blockchain programs (smart contracts) have included serious security vulnerabilities. Obsidian is a new typestate-oriented programming language that uses a strong type system to rule out some of these vulnerabilities. Although Obsidian was designed to promote usability to make it as easy as possible to write programs, strong type systems can cause a language to be difficult to use. In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to provide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular languages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today. We observed that Obsidian participants were able to successfully complete more of the programming tasks than the Solidity participants. We also found that the Solidity participants commonly inserted asset-related bugs, which Obsidian detects at compile time.",

        "Title": "SDN Controllers: A Comprehensive Analysis and Performance Evaluation Study",
        "Abstract": "Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities. This work uses three benchmarking tools to compare 9 controllers and presents a detailed analysis of their performance, along with discussion on performance of specialized network controllers.",

        "Abstract": "The transaction-rate bottleneck built into popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leads to fee markets where transactions are included according to a first-price auction for block space. Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our Machine Learning (ML) model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%. Our findings enable Bitcoin users to improve their fee expenses and the approval time for their transactions.",

        "Abstract": "Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.",

        "Title": "Trade or Trick?: Detecting and Characterizing Scam Tokens on Uniswap Decentralized Exchange",
        "Abstract": "The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the need for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional CEX. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the \"rug pull\" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at least $16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.",

        "Abstract": "Software architectural designs are usually changed over time to support emerging technologies and to adhere to new principles. Architectural migration is an important activity that helps to transform the architectural styles applied during a system\u2019s design with the result of modernising the system. If not performed correctly, this process could lead to potential system failures. This article presents an automated approach to refactoring architectural design and to planning the evolution process. With our solution, the architectural design can be refactored, ensuring that system functionality is preserved. Furthermore, the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world software applications. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach and identify factors that impact the performance of architectural verification and migration planning. An interesting finding is that planning algorithms generate migration plans that differ in term of their relative efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "The production of counterfeit money has a long history. It refers to the creation of imitation currency that is produced without the legal sanction of government. With the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there is expanding evidence that counterfeit cryptocurrency has also appeared. In this paper, we empirically explore the presence of counterfeit cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and measure their impact. By analyzing over 190K ERC-20 tokens (or cryptocurrencies) on Ethereum, we have identified $2,117$ counterfeit tokens that target 94 of the 100 most popular cryptocurrencies. We perform an end-to-end characterization of the counterfeit token ecosystem, including their popularity, creators and holders, fraudulent behaviors and advertising channels. Through this, we have identified two types of scams related to counterfeit tokens and devised techniques to identify such scams. We observe that over 7,104 victims were deceived in these scams, and the overall financial loss sums to a minimum of \\$ 17 million (74,271.7 ETH). Our findings demonstrate the urgency to identify counterfeit cryptocurrencies and mitigate this threat.",

        "Title": "Disentangling Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Compositions",
        "Abstract": "We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.",

        "Abstract": "Online advertising, also known as web advertising or Internet marketing, is the means and process of promoting products and services on the Internet, and it has been one of the important business models for the Internet. Due to its lucrative nature and its large scale of adoption, it has also been a target for malicious parties with various attack aims such as getting a cut of online advertising revenues, obtaining a user\u2019s privacy, and spreading malware. Over the years, a great deal of research has been conducted on online advertising. Recently, the health of the online advertising ecosystem has become more of a concern for both advertisers and regular Internet users. Advertising budgets have been abused, and Internet users\u2019 privacy and security have been infringed. In this article, we broadly study threats to online advertising and trace the root causes from a systems point of view. Existing threat mitigation strategies are also reviewed and analyzed. To protect online advertising, which has been an essential funding source of many free Internet services, several challenges still need to be addressed, including the need for transparency of the advertising ecosystem and software vulnerabilities on the client-side. To overcome these challenges, we conclude by brainstorming some innovative ideas on some potentially interesting and useful research directions.",

        "Title": "How Should We Regulate Cryptocurrencies via Consensus?: A Strategic Framework for Optimal Legal Transaction Throughput",
        "Abstract": "Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions with are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.",

This symbolic value-flow (\u201csymvalic\u201d) analysis models program behavior with high precision, e.g., full path sensitivity. To achieve deep modeling of program semantics, the analysis relies on a symbiotic relationship between a traditional static analysis fixpoint computation and a symbolic solver: the solver does not merely receive a complex \u201cpath condition\u201d to solve, but is instead invoked repeatedly (often tens or hundreds of thousands of times), in close cooperation with the flow computation of the analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas part of the world can benefit from the wonders of digital technologies, undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees are facing the rough reality of being \u201cinvisible\u201d in society and ignored by governments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic impact of the closure of the service industry and the impossibility to keep most of the informal work they perform place them into a limbo without income and unemployment benefits. They are denied formal support because of the lack of a legally recognized identity. For this type of humanitarian support, contemporary identities can offer a way out. Self-sovereign identities (SSI) can provide individuals ownership over their data and the ability to share this with others. The essence is that the owner determines whom they share their identity data with. They have the sole ownership of the identity data. As such, an SSI ensures privacy for undocumented persons. This would allow to provide support to those who are left behind by a lack of formal identity. In this article, we explore the possibility of SSI to assist undocumented individuals throughout the pandemic times. SSI can be used to interact with undocumented workers and to share all kinds of identity data, such as sharing the attestation of COVID-19 tests or the ability to donate money to those who are illegal without sacrificing their identity.",

        "Abstract": "The use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been gaining traction in recent years due to various reasons. While charging their EVs, users expose their identity and personal details, and an adversary being able to identify and track where users charge their EVs is a potential privacy threat. In this article, we propose a user-empowered privacy-preserving authentication protocol for EV charging based on Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to provide Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-security. The proposed method gives users full control over their identities and allows them to remain anonymous while charging from any station. Giving control over their identities empowers users. At the same time, by making use of the concept of VC, other parties can verify that a user is legitimate and authenticate the user before providing charging services. Hence, the proposed protocol makes the charging service available in a secure way, while empowering users and preserving their privacy.",

        "Title": "Safe and Private Forward-trading Platform for Transactive Microgrids",
        "Abstract": "Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.",

Two of Bitcoin\u2019s challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin\u2019s pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the \u201cmonopolistic auction\u201d [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one\u2019s value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.",

        "Title": "Toward Responsible AI: An Overview of Federated Learning for User-centered Privacy-preserving Computing",
        "Abstract": "With the rapid advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications, an increasing concern is on the development and application of responsible AI technologies. Building AI technologies or machine-learning models often requires massive amounts of data, which may include sensitive, user private information to be collected from different sites or countries. Privacy, security, and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the acquisition and integration of these data. It is thus a serious challenge to protect user privacy while achieving high-performance models. This article reviews recent progress of federated learning in addressing this challenge in the context of privacy-preserving computing. Federated learning allows global AI models to be trained and used among multiple decentralized data sources with high security and privacy guarantees, as well as sound incentive mechanisms. This article presents the background, motivations, definitions, architectures, and applications of federated learning as a new paradigm for building privacy-preserving, responsible AI ecosystems.",

Cryptocurrency as its representative implementation, suffers the economic loss due to phishing scams. In our work, accounts and transactions are treated as nodes and edges, thus detection of phishing accounts can be modeled as a node classification problem. Correspondingly, we propose a detecting method based on Graph Convolutional Network and autoencoder to precisely distinguish phishing accounts. Experiments on different large-scale real-world datasets from Ethereum show that our proposed model consistently performs promising results compared with related methods.",

        "Abstract": "Hybrid Casper is the new Ethereum blockchain protocol that uses both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake to reach a consensus between nodes. Here, we analyse the protocol using PRISM+, an extension of the probabilistic model checker PRISM with primitives for expressing blockchain data types. First, we extend PRISM+ to include data types and operations for modelling and analysing Proof of Stake-based consensus protocols. Then, we model Hybrid Casper in PRISM+ as a parallel composition of stochastic processes, thus precisely describing the behaviour of the protocol and highlighting its corner cases. PRISM+ is therefore used to rapidly and automatically analyse the resilience of Hybrid Casper when tuning, up or down, several basic parameters of the protocol, such as the rates of creating blocks, and the strategies for determining penalties. Finally, we study the robustness of Hybrid Casper to two well known attacks: the Eclipse attack and the majority attack.",

The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and expand the cloud services to be allocated at the network\u2019s edge. However, edge-based IoT systems currently face challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management is essential to obtain reliable mining and data fusion, improved user privacy and data security, and provisioning of services with context-awareness. In this survey, we first examine the edge-based IoT architectures currently reported in the literature. Then, a complete review of trust requirements in edge-based IoT systems is produced. Also, we discuss about blockchain as a solution to solve several trust problems in IoT and analyze in detail the correlation between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of performance aspects of trusted edge-based IoT systems and recommend promising research directions.",

        "Title": "Enhancement learning on financial text data",
        "Abstract": "With the fast development of natural language processing (NLP), financial text data processing has gained much attention due to its huge potential business value. Deep learning model based on manual perception-based labeling is commonly used to illustrate implicit meanings behind financial text. However, such manual labeling is costly and subjective, and may not perform well due to its weak link with direct financial trading. This paper therefore proposes a novel learning model called Enhancement Learning (EL) on financial text data by using task-based labeling. Financial text often has its application task. The derived financial trading data from such task called task-based label is objective and links to certain characters of financial text. Compared to model trained only on manual labels, EL consists of two models trained by manual perception-based labels and derived task-based labels respectively. Then, the task-based model will be used as main model to produce initial judgment on text, with the perception-based model as a filter to drop cases which are different from common perception. This task-oriented perception-enhanced approach can improve the performance of financial text data due to its direct link with financial task and further verification from perception. This paper illustrates the proposed Enhancement Learning on financial text data by the case in stock return prediction. Numerical experiments show that EL performs better than both the perception-based model and the task-based model.",

IBM did some pioneering work by architecting and implementing a private blockchain system, and then open sourcing it.

        "Abstract": "Through the collaboration of cloud and edge, cloud-edge computing allows the edge that approximates end-users undertakes those non-computationally intensive service processing of the cloud, reducing the communication overhead and satisfying the low latency requirement of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we study a canonical distributed resource allocation problem arising in blockchains. While distributed resource allocation is a well-studied problem in networking, the blockchain setting additionally requires the solution to be resilient to adversarial behavior from a fraction of nodes. Scaling blockchain performance is a basic research topic; a plethora of solutions (under the umbrella of sharding ) have been proposed in recent years. Although the various sharding solutions share a common thread (they cryptographically stitch together multiple parallel chains), architectural differences lead to differing resource allocation problems. In this paper we make three main contributions: (a) we categorize the different sharding proposals under a common architectural framework, allowing for the emergence of a new, uniformly improved, uni-consensus sharding architecture. (b) We formulate and exactly solve a core resource allocation problem in the uni-consensus sharding architecture -- our solution, Free2shard, is adversary-resistant and achieves optimal throughput. The key technical contribution is a mathematical connection to the classical work of Blackwell approachability in dynamic game theory. (c) We implement the sharding architecture atop a full-stack blockchain in 3000 lines of code in Rust -- we achieve a throughput of more than 250,000 transactions per second with 6 shards, a vast improvement over state-of-the-art.",

        "Abstract": "In Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide a more proper solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other traditional distributed computing. Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within the individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning\u2013based approach to learn the data placement strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through using the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing architecture to simulate IoT environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data transmission time as compared to other strategies.",

        "Title": "Why Do Smart Contracts Self-Destruct? Investigating the Selfdestruct Function on Ethereum",
        "Abstract": "The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.",

        "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) presents a privacy-compliant approach by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, how to motivate data owners to participate in and stay within an FL ecosystem by continuously contributing their data to the FL model remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a hybrid incentive mechanism based on blockchain to address the above challenge. The proposed mechanism comprises two primary smart contract-based modules, namely the reputation module and the reverse auction module. The former is used to dynamically calculate the reputation score of each FL participant. It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed mechanism against the three typical threats. Experimental results indicate that our mechanism can successfully reduce incentive costs while preventing participants from colluding and over-bidding in the data sharing auction.",

        "Title": "LedgerDB: a centralized ledger database for universal audit and verification",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of Blockchain has attracted widespread attention. However, we observe that in practice, many applications on permissioned blockchains do not benefit from the decentralized architecture. When decentralized architecture is used but not required, system performance is often restricted, resulting in low throughput, high latency, and significant storage overhead. Hence, we propose LedgerDB on Alibaba Cloud, which is a centralized ledger database with tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features similar to blockchain, and provides strong auditability. LedgerDB has much higher throughput compared to blockchains. It offers stronger auditability by adopting a TSA two-way peg protocol, which prevents malicious behaviors from both users and service providers. LedgerDB supports verifiable data removals demanded by many real-world applications, which are able to remove obsolete records for storage saving and hide records for regulatory purpose, without compromising its verifiability. Experimental evaluation shows that LedgerDB's throughput is 80X higher than state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric). Many blockchain customers (e.g., IP protection and supply chain) on Alibaba Cloud have switched to LedgerDB for its high throughput, low latency, strong auditability, and ease of use.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed ledgers (DLs) provide many advantages over centralized solutions in Internet of Things projects, including but not limited to improved security, transparency, and fault tolerance. To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA\u2019s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL. The performance analysis results can be used by both system designers and users to support their decision making.",

Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds\u2014by means of an efficient SMT encoding\u2014basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.",

We use a public blockchain to play the role of traditional centralized HIT systems, such that the blockchain deals with cryptocurrency payments and acts as a trustworthy judge to resolve disputes between a worker and a requester in a decentralized setting, preventing false-reporting and free-riding. Our approach neither uses expensive cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, nor sends the worker's answers to the blockchain. Compared with prior works, our approach significantly reduces on-chain cost: it only requires O(1) on-chain storage and O(logN) smart contract computation, where N is the question number of a HIT. Additionally, our approach uses known answers or gold standards to determine the worker's answer quality. To motivate the requester to use honest known answers, the requester cannot learn the worker's answers if the answer quality does not meet the requirement. We further provide formal security definitions for our decentralized HIT and prove security of our construction.",

        "Abstract": "With the increasing number of users in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the public has raised the demand for transaction throughput, and many protocols are designed to improve the throughput following the Nakamoto consensus. Although astonishing progress has been made in the on-chain throughput improvement, high throughput makes the blockchains suffer from the increasing blockchain size, hard forks, and possible attacks. In this work, we propose a quantitative model to describe and analyze the Nakamoto consensus. We then design a robust scheme named Ursa to reduce storage requirements and to reduce the forks by automatically adjusting block size according to users\u2019 needs.",

        "Title": "TokenAware: Accurate and Efficient Bookkeeping Recognition for Token Smart Contracts",
        "Abstract": "Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization. Moreover, we develop an application based on TokenAware to demonstrate how it facilitates malicious behavior detection.",

        "Abstract": "Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.",

Sterling enables privacy-preserving distribution and use of data by using privacy-preserving smart contracts which run on a permissionless blockchain. The privacy-preserving smart contracts, written by data providers and consumers, immutably and irrevocably represent the interests of their creators. In particular, we provide a mechanism for data providers to control the use of their data through automatic verification of data consumer contracts, allowing providers to express constraints such as pricing and differential privacy. Through smart contracts and trusted execution environments, Sterling enables privacy-preserving analytics and machine learning over private data in an efficient manner.

        "Abstract": "Static analysis of smart contracts as-deployed on the Ethereum blockchain has received much recent attention. However, high-precision analyses currently face significant challenges when dealing with the Ethereum VM (EVM) execution model. A major such challenge is the modeling of low-level, transient \u201cmemory\u201d (as opposed to persistent, on-blockchain \u201cstorage\u201d) that smart contracts employ. Statically understanding the usage patterns of memory is non-trivial, due to the dynamic allocation nature of in-memory buffers. We offer an analysis that models EVM memory, recovering high-level concepts (e.g., arrays, buffers, call arguments) via deep modeling of the flow of values. Our analysis opens the door to Ethereum static analyses with drastically increased precision. One such analysis detects the extraction of ERC20 tokens by unauthorized users. For another practical vulnerability (redundant calls, possibly used as an attack vector), our memory modeling yields analysis precision of 89%, compared to 16% for a state-of-the-art tool without precise memory modeling. Additionally, precise memory modeling enables the static computation of a contract\u2019s gas cost. This gas-cost analysis has recently been instrumental in the evaluation of the impact of the EIP-1884 repricing (in terms of gas costs) of EVM operations, leading to a reward and significant publicity from the Ethereum Foundation.",

        "Title": "A study of inline assembly in solidity smart contracts",
        "Abstract": "The Solidity programming language is the most widely used language for smart contract development. Improving smart contracts\u2019 correctness, security, and performance has been the driving force for research in vulnerability detection, program analysis, and compiler techniques for Solidity. Similar to system-level languages such as C, Solidity enables the embedding of low-level code in programs, in the form of inline assembly code. Developers use inline assembly for low-level optimizations, extending the Solidity language through libraries, and using blockchain-specific opcodes only available through inline assembly. Nevertheless, inline assembly fragments are not well understood by an average developer and can introduce security threats as well as affect the optimizations that can be applied to programs by the compiler; it also significantly limits the effectiveness of source code static analyzers that operate on the Solidity level. A better understanding of how inline assembly is used in practice could in turn increase the performance, security, and support for inline assembly in Solidity. This paper presents a large-scale quantitative study of the use of inline assembly in 6.8M smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that 23% of the analyzed smart contracts contain inline assembly code, and that the use of inline assembly has become more widespread over time. We further performed a manual qualitative analysis for identifying usage patterns of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts. Our findings are intended to help practitioners understand when they should use inline assembly and guide developers of Solidity tools in prioritizing which parts of inline assembly to implement first. Finally, the insights of this study could be used to enhance the Solidity language, improve the Solidity compiler, and to open up new research directions by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for replacing inline assembly in Solidity programs when there is no real necessity to use it.",

We show that the direct application of state-of-the-art privacy-preserving Differential Private techniques is weak against background knowledge attacker models. We present different scenarios where randomizing separate releases independently is vulnerable to correlation attacks.

        "Abstract": "Urban crime is an ongoing problem in metropolitan development and attracts general concern from the international community. As an effective means of defending urban safety, crime prediction plays a crucial role in patrol force allocation and public safety. However, urban crime data is a macro result of crime patterns overlapped by various irrelevant factors that cause inhomogeneous noises\u2014local outliers and irregular waves. These noises might obstruct the learning process of crime prediction models and result in a deviation of performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel paradigm of <underline>Du</underline>al-<underline>ro</underline>bust Enhanced Spatial-temporal Learning <underline>Net</underline>work (DuroNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that possesses an adaptive robustness for reducing the effect of outliers and waves. The robustness is mainly reflected on two aspects. One is a locality enhanced module that employs local temporal context information to smooth the deviation of outliers and dynamic spatial information to assist in understanding normal points. The other is a self-attention-based pattern representation module to weaken the effect of irregular waves by learning attentive weights. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world crime datasets before and after adding Gaussian noises. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our DuroNet over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Title": "PROLISEAN: A New Security Protocol for Programmable Matter",
        "Abstract": "The vision for programmable matter is to create a material that can be reprogrammed to have different shapes and to change its physical properties on demand. They are autonomous systems composed of a huge number of independent connected elements called particles. The connections to one another form the overall shape of the system. These particles are capable of interacting with each other and take decisions based on their environment. Beyond sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, programmable matter includes actuation and motion capabilities. It could be deployed in different domains and will constitute an intelligent component of the IoT. A lot of applications can derive from this technology, such as medical or industrial applications. However, just like any other technology, security is a huge concern. Given its distributed architecture and its processing limitations, programmable matter cannot handle the traditional security protocols and encryption algorithms. This article proposes a new security protocol optimized and dedicated for IoT programmable matter. This protocol is based on lightweight cryptography and uses the same encryption protocol as a hashing function while keeping the distributed architecture in mind. The analysis and simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method and that a supercomputer will need about 5.93 \u00d7 1025 years to decrypt the message.",

        "Title": "The Cloud-edge-based Dynamic Reconfiguration to Service Workflow for Mobile Ecommerce Environments: A QoS Prediction Perspective",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of mobile service composition meets the current needs for real-time eCommerce. However, the requirements for eCommerce, such as safety and timeliness, are becoming increasingly strict. Thus, the cloud-edge hybrid computing model has been introduced to accelerate information processing, especially in a mobile scenario. However, the mobile environment is characterized by limited resource storage and users who frequently move, and these characteristics strongly affect the reliability of service composition running in this environment. Consequently, applications are likely to fail if inappropriate services are invoked. To ensure that the composite service can operate normally, traditional dynamic reconfiguration methods tend to focus on cloud services scheduling. Unfortunately, most of these approaches cannot support timely responses to dynamic changes. In this article, the cloud-edge based dynamic reconfiguration to service workflow for mobile eCommerce environments is proposed. First, the service quality concept is extended. Specifically, the value and cost attributes of a service are considered. The value attribute is used to assess the stability of the service for some time to come, and the cost attribute is the cost of a service invocation. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict the stability of services, which is related to the calculation of the value attribute. Then, in view of the limited available equipment resources, a method for calculating the cost of calling a service is introduced. Third, candidate services are selected by considering both service stability and the cost of service invocation, thus yielding a dynamic reconfiguration scheme that is more suitable for the cloud-edge environment. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out, and the experimental results prove that the method proposed in this article offers higher stability, less energy consumption, and more accurate service prediction.",

        "Title": "Privacy Care: A Tangible Interaction Framework for Privacy Management",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) environments has increased the risk of undesired access to individuals\u2019 physical space or their information, anytime and anywhere, raising potentially serious privacy concerns. Individuals lack awareness and control of the vulnerabilities in everyday contexts and need support and care in regulating disclosures to their physical and digital selves. Existing GUI-based solutions, however, often feel physically interruptive, socially disruptive, time-consuming and cumbersome. To address such challenges, we investigate the user interaction experience and discuss the need for more tangible and embodied interactions for effective and seamless natural privacy management in everyday UbiComp settings. We propose the Privacy Care interaction framework, which is rooted in the literature of privacy management and tangible computing. Keeping users at the center, Awareness and Control are established as the core parts of our framework. This is supported with three interrelated interaction tenets: Direct, Ready-to-Hand, and Contextual. Direct refers to intuitiveness through metaphor usage. Ready-to-Hand supports granularity, non-intrusiveness, and ad hoc management, through periphery-to-center style attention transitions. Contextual supports customization through modularity and configurability. Together, they aim to provide experience of an embodied privacy care with varied interactions that are calming and yet actively empowering. The framework provides designers of such care with a basis to refer to, to generate effective tangible tools for privacy management in everyday settings.",

        "Title": "Enabling User-centered Privacy Controls for Mobile Applications: COVID-19 Perspective",
        "Abstract": "Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people\u2019s attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people\u2019s adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users\u2019 preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users\u2019 preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development. Through our research findings, we suggest mechanisms for designing inclusive apps\u2019 privacy and security measures that can be put into practice for healthcare-related apps, so that timely adoption is made possible.",

This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies. We will discuss how fine-grained function-level dependencies can greatly improve reliability and reduce the impact of vulnerabilities on the whole software ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "IoT devices generate massive amounts of biomedical data with increased digitalization and development of the state-of-the-art automated clinical data collection systems. When combined with advanced machine learning algorithms, the big data could be useful to improve the health systems for decision-making, diagnosis, and treatment. Mental healthcare is also attracting attention, since most medical problems can be associated with mental states. Affective computing is among the emerging biomedical informatics fields for automatically monitoring a person\u2019s mental state in ambulatory environments by using physiological and physical signals. However, although affective computing applications are promising to improve our daily lives, before analyzing physiological signals, privacy issues and concerns need to be dealt with. Federated learning is a promising candidate for developing high-performance models while preserving the privacy of individuals. It is a privacy protection solution that stores model parameters instead of the data itself and abides by the data protection laws such as EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We applied federated learning to heart activity data collected with smart bands for stress-level monitoring in different events. We achieved encouraging results for using federated learning in IoT-based wearable biomedical monitoring systems by preserving the privacy of the data.",

        "Abstract": "Consumer behavior plays a very important role in economics and targeted marketing. However, understanding economic consumer behavior is quite challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product profitability. Different from frequent pattern mining, utility-oriented mining integrates utility theory and data mining. Utility mining is a useful tool for understanding economic consumer behavior. Traditional algorithms for mining high-utility patterns (HUPs) applies a single/uniform minimum utility threshold (minutil) to obtain the set of HUPs, but in some real-life circumstances, some specific products may bring lower utilities compared with others, but their profit may offer some vital information. If minutil is set high, the patterns with low minutil are missed; if minutil is set low, the number of patterns becomes unmanageable. In this article, an efficient one-phase utility-oriented pattern mining algorithm, called HIMU, is proposed for mining HUPs with varied item-specific minimum utility. A novel tree structure called a multiple item utility set-enumeration tree (MIU-tree) and the global sorted and the conditional downward closure properties are introduced in HIMU. In addition, we extended the compact utility-list structure to keep the necessary information, and thus this one-phase HIMU model greatly reduces the computational costs and memory requirements. Moreover, two pruning strategies are then extended to enhance the performance. We conducted extensive experiments in several synthetic and real-world datasets; the results indicate that the designed one-phase HIMU algorithm can address the \u201crare item problem\u201d and has better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability. Furthermore, the enhanced algorithms outperform the non-optimized HIMU approach.",

In the gateway-based IoT architecture, gateways aggregate data collected by perception-layer devices and upload message packets to platforms, while platforms automatically push different categories of data to different applications. However, security in processes of data transmission via gateways, storage in platforms, access by applications is the major challenge for user privacy protection. To tackle this challenge, this article presents a secure IoT scheme based on a fine-grained multi-receive signcryption scheme to realize end-to-end secure transmission and data access control. To enhance the security of online application decryption keys, we design a distributed threshold decryption scheme based on secret-sharing. Moreover, from the provable security perspective, we demonstrate that the scheme can achieve the expected IND-CCA security and EUF-CMA security. After the performance analysis, evaluation results show that the computational performance is efficient and linearly subject to the number of messages and the number of receivers.",

Watermarking is used for various notable applications to secure digital data from unauthorized individuals. To achieve this, in this article, we propose a joint encryption then-compression based watermarking technique for digital document security. This technique offers a tool for confidentiality, copyright protection, and strong compression performance of the system. The proposed method involves three major steps as follows: (1) embedding of multiple watermarks through non-sub-sampled contourlet transform, redundant discrete wavelet transform, and singular value decomposition; (2) encryption and compression via SHA-256 and Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), respectively; and (3) extraction/recovery of multiple watermarks from the possibly distorted cover image. The performance estimations are carried out on various images at different attacks, and the efficiency of the system is determined in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation (NC), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), number of changing pixel rate (NPCR), unified averaged changed intensity (UACI), and compression ratio (CR). Furthermore, the comparative analysis of the proposed system with similar schemes indicates its superiority to them.",

        "Abstract": "Next (or successive) point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict where users are likely to go next, has recently emerged as a new research focus of POI recommendation. Most of the previous studies on next POI recommendation attempted to incorporate the spatiotemporal information and sequential patterns of user check-ins into recommendation models to predict the target user's next move. However, few of the next POI recommendation approaches utilized the social influence of each user's friends. In this study, we discuss a new topic of next POI recommendation and present a deep attentive network for social-aware next POI recommendation called DAN-SNR. In particular, the DAN-SNR makes use of the self-attention mechanism instead of the architecture of recurrent neural networks to model sequential influence and social influence in a unified manner. Moreover, we design and implement two parallel channels to capture short-term user preference and long-term user preference as well as social influence, respectively. By leveraging multi-head self-attention, the DAN-SNR can model long-range dependencies between any two historical check-ins efficiently and weigh their contributions to the next destination adaptively. We also carried out a comprehensive evaluation using large-scale real-world datasets collected from two popular location-based social networks, namely, Gowalla and Brightkite. Experimental results indicate that the DAN-SNR outperforms seven competitive baseline approaches regarding recommendation performance and is highly efficient among six neural-network-based methods, four of which utilize the attention mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "With the explosive growth in the number of IoT devices, ensuring the integrity of the massive data generated by these devices has become an important issue. Due to the limitation of hardware, most past data integrity verification schemes randomly select partial data blocks and then perform integrity validation on those blocks instead of examining the entire dataset. This will result in that unsampled data blocks cannot be detected even if they are tampered with. To solve this problem, we propose a new and effective integrity auditing mechanism of sensor data based on a bilinear map accumulator. Using the proposed approach will examine all the data blocks in the dataset, not just some of the data blocks, thus, eliminating the possibility of any cloud manipulation. Compared with other schemes, our proposed solution has been proved to be highly secure for all necessary security requirements, including tag forgery, data deletion, replacement, replay, and data leakage attacks. The solution reduces the computational and storage costs of cloud storage providers and verifiers, and also supports dynamic operations for data owners to insert, delete, and update data by using a tag index table (TIT). Compared with existing schemes based on RSA accumulator, our scheme has the advantages of fast verification and witness generation and no need to map data blocks to prime numbers. The new solution supports all the characteristics of a data integrity verification scheme.",

Given the significance of smart contracts in supporting important activities across industry sectors including supply chain, finance, legal, and medical services, there is a strong demand for verification and validation techniques. Yet, the vast majority of smart contracts lack any kind of formal specification, which is essential for establishing their correctness. In this survey, we investigate formal models and specifications of smart contracts presented in the literature and present a systematic overview to understand the common trends. We also discuss the current approaches used in verifying such property specifications and identify gaps with the hope to recognize promising directions for future work.",

This paper considers possible attacks related to the decentralized network architecture of Bitcoin. We perform a data driven study of Bitcoin and present possible attacks based on spatial and temporal characteristics of its network. Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to the network dynamics. We verify our observations through data-driven analyses and simulations, and discuss the implications of each attack on the Bitcoin network. We conclude with suggested countermeasures.",

Addressing this challenge brings up familiar questions from classical distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action, how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data. Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial. We propose the notion of a cross-chain deal, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger. We also prove that some degree of centralization is required in the semi-synchronous communication model.",

In this paper, we propose a new technique for reducing the gas usage of smart contracts by changing the underlying data layout. Given a smart contract P and a type-level transformation, our method automatically synthesizes a new contract P\u2032 that is functionally equivalent to P. Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation. In particular, we show that our approach is effective at automating the desired data layout transformation and that it is useful for reducing gas usage of smart contracts that use rich data structures.",

The memory hardness, or the amount of memory access, of these PoW algorithms is to prevent the dominance of custom-made hardware of massive computation units, in particular, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) machines, in the system. However, it is unclear how effective these algorithms are on general-purpose processors.",

        "Title": "Federated Route Leak Detection in Inter-domain Routing with Privacy Guarantee",
        "Abstract": "In the inter-domain network, route leaks can disrupt the Internet traffic and cause large outages. The accurate detection of route leaks requires the sharing of AS business relationship information. However, the business relationship information between ASes is confidential. ASes are usually unwilling to reveal this information to the other ASes, especially their competitors. In this paper, we propose a method named FL-RLD to detect route leaks while maintaining the privacy of business relationships between ASes by using a blockchain-based federated learning framework, where ASes can collaboratively train a global detection model without directly disclosing their specific business relationships. To mitigate the lack of ground-truth validation data in route leaks, FL-RLD provides a self-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies. We evaluate FL-RLD under a variety of datasets including imbalanced and balanced datasets, and examine different deployment strategies of FL-RLD under different topologies. According to the results, FL-RLD performs better in detecting route leaks than the single AS detection, whether the datasets are balanced or imbalanced. Additionally, the results indicate that selecting ASes with the most peers to first deploy FL-RLD brings more significant benefits in detecting route leaks than selecting ASes with the most providers and customers.",

Numerous AI-supported IoT devices are playing a significant role in providing complex and user-specific smart city services. Given the multitude of heterogeneous wireless networks, the plethora of computer and storage architectures and paradigms, and the abundance of mobile and vehicular IoT devices, true smart city experiences are only attainable through a cooperative intelligent and secure IoT framework. This article provides an extensive study on different cooperative systems and envisions a cooperative solution that supports the integration and collaboration among both centralized and distributed systems, in which intelligent AI-supported IoT devices such as smart UAVs provide support in the data collection, processing and service provisioning process. Moreover, secure and collaborative decentralized solutions such as Blockchain are considered in the service provisioning process to enable enhanced privacy and authentication features for IoT applications.

        "Abstract": "Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms that restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic consent (e-consent) has the potential to solve many paper-based consent approaches. Existing approaches, however, face challenges regarding privacy and security. This literature review aims to provide an overview of privacy and security challenges and requirements proposed by papers discussing e-consent implementations, as well as the manner in which state-of-the-art solutions address them. We conducted a systematic literature search using ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed Central. We included papers providing comprehensive discussions of one or more technical aspects of e-consent systems. Thirty-one papers met our inclusion criteria. Two distinct topics were identified, the first being discussions of e-consent representations and the second being implementations of e-consent in data sharing systems. The main challenge for e-consent representations is gathering the requirements for a \u201cvalid\u201d consent. For the implementation papers, many provided some requirements but none provided a comprehensive overview. Blockchain is identified as a solution to transparency and trust issues in traditional client-server systems, but several challenges hinder it from being applied in practice. E-consent has the potential to grant data subjects control over their data. However, there is no agreed-upon set of security and privacy requirements that must be addressed by an e-consent platform. Therefore, security- and privacy-by-design techniques should be an essential part of the development lifecycle for such a platform.",

        "Abstract": "Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based ledger and the corresponding consensus algorithm has been identified as a promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT). Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that have been widely used in blockchain, the consensus mechanism designed on DAG structure (simply called as DAG consensus) can overcome some shortcomings such as high resource consumption, high transaction fee, low transaction throughput and long confirmation delay. However, the theoretic analysis on the DAG consensus is an untapped venue to be explored. To this end, based on one of the most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on the proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the probability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load regimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus process, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the probability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the trade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.",

        "Title": "Interactive verification of architectural design patterns in FACTum",
        "Abstract": "Architectural design patterns (ADPs) are architectural solutions to common architectural design problems. They are an important concept in software architectures used for the design and analysis of architectures. An ADP usually constrains the design of an architecture and, in turn, guarantees some desired properties for architectures implementing it. Sometimes, however, the constraints imposed by an ADP do not lead to the claimed guarantee. Thus, applying such patterns for the design of architectures might result in architectures which do not fulfill their intended requirements. To address this problem, we propose an approach for the verification of ADPs, based on interactive theorem proving. To this end, we introduce a model for dynamic architectures and a language for the specification of ADPs over this model. Moreover, we propose a framework for the interactive verification of such specifications based on Isabelle/HOL. In addition we describe an algorithm to map a specifi cation to a corresponding Isabelle/HOL theory over our framework. To evaluate the approach, we implement it in Eclipse/EMF and use it for the verification of four ADPs: variants of the Singleton, the Publisher-Subscriber, the Blackboard pattern, and a pattern for Blockchain architectures. With our approach we complement traditional approaches for the verification of architectures, which are usually based on automatic verification techniques such as model checking.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are tempting targets of attacks, since they often hold and manipulate significant financial assets, are immutable after deployment, and have publicly available source code, with assets estimated in the order of millions of US Dollars being lost in the past due to vulnerabilities. Formal verification is thus a necessity, but smart contracts challenge the existing highly efficient techniques routinely applied in the symbolic verification of software, due to specificities not present in general programming languages. A common feature of existing works in this area is the attempt to reuse off-the-shelf verification tools designed for general programming languages. This reuse can lead to inefficiency and potentially unsound results, since domain translation is required. In this paper we describe a carefully crafted approach that directly models the central aspects of smart contracts natively, going from the contract to its logical representation without intermediary steps. We use the expressive and highly automatable logic of constrained Horn clauses for modeling and we instantiate our approach to the Solidity language. A tool implementing our approach, called Solicitous, was developed and integrated into the SMTChecker module of the Solidity compiler solc. We evaluated our approach on an extensive benchmark set containing 22446 real-world smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain over a 27 months period. The results show that our approach is able to establish safety of significantly more contracts than comparable, publicly available verification tools, with an order of magnitude increase in the percentage of formally verified contracts.",

        "Title": "An Effective and Lightweight Countermeasure Scheme to Multiple Network Attacks in NDN",
        "Abstract": "In Named Data Networking, cache pollution, cache poisoning and interest flooding are three popular types of attacks that can drastically degrade the network performance. However, previous methods for mitigating these attacks are not sufficiently effective or efficient. Also, they cannot simultaneously handle the three attacks, or the case that core routers or edge routers are compromised. To handle these problems, we propose an effective and lightweight countermeasure scheme. It consists of token-based router monitoring policy (TRM), hierarchical consensus-based trust management (HCT), and popularity-based probabilistic caching and caching replacement policy (PPC). In TRM, each edge router monitors and evaluates each data requester&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache pollution attack and each data provider&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache poisoning attack, and accordingly assigns, rewards and penalizes tokens to them to control their data request and data provision activities. Thus, the interest flooding attack can also be mitigated by limiting the consumption of tokens. In HCT, each core router manages its directly connected edge routers using TRM, and the core routers trust each other through adopting the concept of consensus in Blockchain. Thus, the edge and core routers executing monitoring and evaluation are trustable. PPC uses probabilistic caching and caching replacement based on the popularity of received content to further mitigate the attacks and reduce caching and data verification overhead. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance, in terms of interest satisfaction ratio and average end-to-end delay than current mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Secret image sharing (SIS) has received increased attention from the research community because of its usefulness in multiparty secure computing, access control, blockchain distributive storage and other security-oriented applications. Prevention of fake and dishonest participants is a key issue that has spurred interest in practical applications of SIS. Unfortunately, most previous SIS schemes failed to detect and locate fake or dishonest participants. In this article, an SIS for a (k, n)-threshold without pixel expansion is presented, which can detect and locate both fake and dishonest participants. Using a screening operation, the proposed approach fuses the benefits of polynomial-based SIS, visual cryptographic scheme (VCS), and hash functions to authenticate separate participants both with and without a dealer. In addition, the proposed approach achieves lossless rebuilding of the secret image. Analyses and experiments are conducted in this study to establish the effectiveness of the presented approach.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, a new generation of the Internet of Things (IoT 2.0) is emerging, based on artificial intelligence, the blockchain technology, machine learning, and the constant consolidation of pre-existing systems and subsystems into larger systems. In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.",

We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction of 1/5 of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size.",

The proposed Calypso architecture addresses two orthogonal challenges confronting modern distributed ledgers: (a) enabling the auditable management of secrets and (b) protecting distributed computations against arbitrage attacks when their results depend on the ordering and secrecy of inputs.",

However, existing HCI methods can be impractical to apply to programming languages: languages have high iteration costs, programmers require significant learning time, and user performance has high variance. To address these problems, we adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. We integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. We assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement.",

In this article, we focus on enhancing the audit strategies and the privacy issues emerging from records kept for audit purposes. We propose enhanced audit and collaboration strategies, for which experimental results, on a real online social network graph with simulated sharing behavior, show an improvement in the detection rate of bad behavior of more than 50% compared to the basic model. We also provide an analysis of the related privacy issues and discuss possible privacy-preserving alternatives.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain consensus refers to the process of validating the network's status by guaranteeing that all blocks include the same information and have the correct values across all nodes. A cryptocurrency, often known as \"crypto,\" is digital money that uses the Proof of Work (PoW) method to establish consensus. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to establish consensus, which is a time-consuming and resource-intensive procedure. Miners expend a lot of energy to perform a brute-force search for the desired hash value using a nonce that isn't helpful otherwise, in order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. A nonce is a one-time-use value that, when appended to a block and hashed, ensures that the output of the block hash begins with the correct number of zeros. In this paper, we present machine learning-based methods that give a quicker means of establishing consensus and create a template for Proof of Work protocols that ensure similar security guarantees as Bitcoin. To forecast the nonce value from block headers properties, we utilize a mix of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Our approach minimizes the protocol's time and energy usage by quickly determining the correct nonce value while maintaining security and decentralization.",

Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2) consistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this by decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the ordering process.",

Smart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial outside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses can (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to manipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely requires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not fully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or expressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and offering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract performs.",

        "Title": "Federated Learning for Smart Healthcare: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.",

Hence, in this paper we survey the literature to provide an in-depth understanding of the existing approaches for personal data control (e.g., we observe that most existing approaches are generally designed to facilitate compliance), as well as the privacy regulations in Europe, United Kingdom, California, South Korea, and Japan. Based on the review, we identify the associated technical requirements, as well as a number of research gaps and potential future directions (e.g., the need for transparent processing of personal data and establishment of clear procedure in ensuring personal data control).",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are automated or self-enforcing contracts that can be used to exchange assets without having to place trust in third parties. Many commercial transactions use smart contracts due to their potential benefits in terms of secure peer-to-peer transactions independent of external parties. Experience shows that many commonly used smart contracts are vulnerable to serious malicious attacks, which may enable attackers to steal valuable assets of involving parties. There is, therefore, a need to apply analysis and automated repair techniques to detect and repair bugs in smart contracts before being deployed. In this work, we present the first general-purpose automated smart contract repair approach that is also gas-aware. Our repair method is search-based and searches among mutations of the buggy contract. Our method also considers the gas usage of the candidate patches by leveraging our novel notion of gas dominance relationship. We have made our smart contract repair tool SCRepair available open-source, for investigation by the wider community.",

        "Abstract": "Edge networks are providing services for an increasing number of companies, and they can be used for communication between edge devices and edge gateways. However, the performance of edge devices varies greatly, and it is not easy to upgrade low-performance edge devices. Therefore, cyber attackers can use the vulnerability of edge devices to implement advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. This paper proposes a network verification framework for edge networks that can minimize the upgrades needed to strengthen edge network security. First, the communication parties use the data transmitted by the given edge network. Our method uses our proposed PacketVerifier to attach verification information to the packet after it is sent and to verify and restore the packet before it reaches the receiver. Second, due to the performance requirements of edge networks, we design a new data processing structure, namely, a sliding window double ring (SWDR), to improve the performance of strict sequential protocols in parallel validation. Finally, experimental simulations show that our parallel processing algorithm has good performance in terms of network bandwidth compared with two existing packet processing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed packet with verification information is compatible with the existing network topology, which helps PacketVerifier establish trustworthy transmission in a zero-trust environment.",

        "Abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, all entities in the IoT network, whether home users or industrial things, receive data from other things to make decisions. However, in the decentralized, heterogeneous, and rapidly changing IoT network with billions of devices, deciding about where to get the services or information from is critical, especially because malicious entities can exist in such an unmanaged network. Security provisioning alone cannot solve the issue of service quality or reliability. One way to elevate security and reliability in the IoT network is to bridge the gap of trust between objects, and also between humans and objects, while taking into account the IoT network characteristics. Therefore, a proper trust management system must be established on top of the IoT network service architecture. Trust is related to the manner expected from objects in providing services and recommendations. Recommendations are the basis of decision making in every trust management system. Since trust management ideas in the IoT are still immature, the purpose of this article is to survey, analyze, and compare the approaches that have been taken in building trust management systems for the IoT. We break down the features of such systems by analysis and also do quantitative comparisons by simulation. This article is organized into two main parts. First, studies and approaches in this field are compared from four perspectives: (1) trust computation method, (2) resistance to attacks (3) adherence to the limitations of IoT networks and devices, and (4) performance of the trust management scheme. The second part is quantitative and simulates four major methods in this field and measures their performance. We also make extensive analytical comparisons to demonstrate the similarities and discrepancies of current IoT trust management schemes and extract the essence of a resilient trust management framework.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things is taking hold in our everyday life. Regrettably, the security of IoT devices is often being overlooked. Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging IoT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies IoT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community. Finally, we provide an architecture-based taxonomy and future research directions: a focus on hybrid architectures, usability, flexibility, privacy, and revocation schemes in serverless authorization.",

This article presents a novel technique to recognize the characters in the number plate automatically by using connected component analysis (CCA), artificial neural network (ANN) and neural natural network (Triple N). The preprocessing steps, Sobel edge detection technique and CCA are applied to the captured image of the vehicle to obtain character images. ANN technique can be used over these images to recognize the characters of the image in bioinformatics. The preprocessing steps are used to remove the noise and to enhance the image for recognizing the characters effectively. After performing the preprocessing steps, the edge detection technique and CCA are carried out to separate the character images from the whole image which can be recognized using ANN. These text characters can be compared with database to find authentication of vehicle, identifying the owner of the vehicle, penalty bill generation, etc.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the rapid growth and advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT), there are critical challenges that need to be addressed before the full adoption of the IoT. Data privacy is one of the hurdles towards the adoption of IoT as there might be potential misuse of users\u2019 data and their identity in IoT applications. Several researchers have proposed different approaches to reduce privacy risks. However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications. Based on the classification, we highlight ongoing research efforts and limitations of the existing privacy-preservation techniques and map the existing IoT schemes with Fog-enabled IoT schemes to elaborate on the benefits and improvements that Fog-enabled IoT can bring to preserve data privacy in IoT applications. Lastly, we enumerate key research challenges and point out future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world\u2019s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "Live video streaming services have experienced significant growth since the emergence of social networking paradigms in recent years. In this scenario, adaptive bitrate streaming communications transmitted on web protocols provide a convenient and cost-efficient facility to serve various multimedia platforms over the Internet. In these communication models, video content is delivered optimally, possibly transcoded, edited automatically, and cached temporarily by network elements along the path. To this end, the computational capabilities of various network elements are considered as major resources to be optimized for service quality improvements. This article provides a contemporary survey of cutting-edge live video streaming studies from a computation-driven perspective. First, an overview of the global standards, system architectures, and streaming protocols is presented. Next, hierarchical computation-driven models of live video streaming are anatomized, including cloud-, edge-, and peer-to-peer-based solutions. Cutting-edge studies are then reviewed to discover the advances they have made in improving system performance in multiple areas. Finally, open challenges are presented to direct future research in this field.",

        "Abstract": "Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence (C3I) systems are increasingly used in critical civil and military domains for achieving information superiority, operational efficacy, and greater situational awareness. The critical civil and military domains include, but are not limited to battlefield, healthcare, transportation, and rescue missions. Given the sensitive nature and modernization of tactical domains, the security of C3I systems has recently become a critical concern. This is because cyber-attacks on C3I systems have catastrophic consequences including loss of human lives. Despite the increasing number of cyber-attacks on C3I systems and growing concerns about C3I systems\u2019 security, there is a paucity of a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. Therefore, in this paper, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. We have identified and reported security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. In particular, this paper has enabled us to (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems. We believe that our findings will serve as a guideline for practitioners and researchers to advance the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems.",

        "Abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are effectively utilized in various complicated challenges in healthcare, industry, and academia. The Internet of Drones (IoD) has lately cropped up due to high adjustability to a broad range of unpredictable circumstances. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be utilized efficiently in a multitude of scenarios, including rescue missions and search, farming, mission-critical services, surveillance systems, and so on, owing to technical and realistic benefits such as low movement, the capacity to lengthen wireless coverage zones, and the ability to attain places unreachable to human beings. In many studies, IoD and UAV are utilized interchangeably. Besides, drones enhance the efficiency aspects of various network topologies, including delay, throughput, interconnectivity, and dependability. Nonetheless, the deployment of drone systems raises various challenges relating to the inherent unpredictability of the wireless medium, the high mobility degrees, and the battery life that could result in rapid topological changes. In this paper, the IoD is originally explained in terms of potential applications and comparative operational scenarios. Then, we classify ML in the IoD-UAV world according to its applications, including resource management, surveillance and monitoring, object detection, power control, energy management, mobility management, and security management. This research aims to supply the readers with a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of IoD/UAV, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that need further investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is the most often employed ML method in publications. According to research, most papers are on resource and mobility management. Most articles have focused on enhancing only one parameter, with the accuracy parameter receiving the most attention. Also, Python is the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 90% of the time. Also, in 2021, it has the most papers published.",

During any given period of time, each participant may only interact with a few other participants. Simply relying on direct trust may frequently resort to random team formation. Thus, trust aggregation becomes critical. It can leverage decentralized trust management to learn about indirect trust of every participant based on past transaction experiences. This article presents alternative designs of decentralized trust management and their efficiency and robustness from three perspectives. First, we study the risk factors and adverse effects of six common threat models. Second, we review the representative trust aggregation models and trust metrics. Third, we present an in-depth analysis and comparison of these reference trust aggregation methods with respect to effectiveness and robustness. We show our comparative study results through formal analysis and experimental evaluation. This comprehensive study advances the understanding of adverse effects of present and future threats and the robustness of different trust metrics. It may also serve as a guideline for research and development of next-generation trust aggregation algorithms and services in the anticipation of risk factors and mischievous threats.",

        "Abstract": "Data provenance, a record that describes the origins and processing of data, offers new promises in the increasingly important role of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems in guiding human decision making. To avoid disastrous outcomes that can result from bias-laden AI systems, responsible AI builds on four important characteristics: fairness, accountability, transparency, and explainability. To stimulate further research on data provenance that enables responsible AI, this study outlines existing biases and discusses possible implementations of data provenance to mitigate them. We first review biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing. We then discuss the current state of practice, the challenges it presents, and corresponding recommendations to address them. We present a summary highlighting how our recommendations can help establish data provenance and thereby mitigate biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing to realize responsible AI-based systems. We conclude with a research agenda suggesting further research avenues.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a promising role in e-healthcare applications in the recent decades; nevertheless, security is one of the crucial challenges in the current field of study. Many healthcare devices (for instance, a sensor-augmented insulin pump and heart-rate sensor) collect a user\u2019s real-time data (such as glucose level and heart rate) and send them to the cloud for proper analysis and diagnosis of the user. However, the real-time user\u2019s data are vulnerable to various authentication attacks while sending through an insecure channel. Besides that, the attacks may further open scope for many other subsequent attacks. Existing security mechanisms concentrate on two-party mutual authentication. However, an IoT-enabled healthcare application involves multiple parties such as a patient, e-healthcare test-equipment, doctors, and cloud servers that requires multi-party authentication for secure communication. Moreover, the design and implementation of a lightweight security mechanism that fits into the resource constraint IoT-enabled healthcare devices are challenging. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight, multi-party authentication and key-establishment protocol in IoT-based e-healthcare service access network to counter the attacks in resource constraint devices. The proposed multi-party protocol has used a lattice-based cryptographic construct such as Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to acquire security, privacy, and efficiency. The study provided all-round analysis of the scheme, such as security, power consumption, and practical usage, in the following ways. The proposed scheme is tested by a formal security tool, Scyther, to testify the security properties of the protocol. In addition, security analysis for various attacks and comparison with other existing works are provided to show the robust security characteristics. Further, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using IBE cryptographic construct is provided to validate the practical usage. The power consumption of the scheme is also computed and compared with existing works to evaluate its efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Out-of-gas errors occur when smart contract programs are provided with inputs that cause excessive gas consumption and which will be easily exploited to perform DoS attacks. Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the gas limit of a function in smart contracts to avoid such error. However, underestimation often occurs when the contract is complex In this work, we propose V-Gas, which automatically generates inputs that maximize the gas cost and reduce underestimation. V-Gas is designed based on static analysis and feedback-directed mutational fuzz testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted control flow graph (WCFG) of functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops gas consumption guided selection and mutation strategies to generate the input that maximize the gas consumption.",

        "Abstract": "Mining pools have become dominant in today&#x2019;s bitcoin mining network, where miners can pool their powers together for reduced variance of block mining and steadier stream of potential income. Along with the continuous evolvement of mining pools are the increasingly intense competitions among them. Recent empirical studies have shown that the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common ways for competing mining pools to sabotage the rivals and earn illegitimate rewards. Existing efforts have been made on using static game models to analyze the interactions between mining pools, and derive the Nash Equilibrium and optimal attacking strategies in a one-time static context. To better understand the impact of such DDoS attacks, in this paper, we take a starkly different approach, and for the first time address the dynamics in mining pool attacks. Specifically, we start by formulating the interactive competition among mining pools as a general-sum stochastic game. Then we propose an efficient Nash learning algorithm to obtain the near optimal attacking strategy that maximizes the expected long-term utility. Our theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results both show that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline myopic learning algorithm, which only aims at maximizing the revenue in the current time stage. These findings, together with our proposed stochastic game model and learning algorithm, are expected to provide more practical guidelines for mining pools to survive and thrive in the highly-competitive bitcoin ecosystem.",

        "Title": "Commoning for Fun and Profit: Experimental Publishing on the Decentralized Web",
        "Abstract": "The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.",

        "Title": "StarFL: Hybrid Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Urban Computing",
        "Abstract": "From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.",

Technological innovations, price fluctuations of raw materials, as well as tax, regulatory, and market demands are driving change and making the pharmaceutical supply chain more complex. Traditional supply chain management methods struggle to protect the pharmaceutical supply chain, maintain its integrity, enhance customer confidence, and aid regulators in tracking medicines. To develop effective measures that secure the pharmaceutical supply chain, it is important that the community is aware of the state-of-the-art capabilities available to the supply chain owners and participants. In this article, we will be presenting a survey of existing hardware-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain security schemes and their limitations. We also highlight the current challenges and point out future research directions. This survey should be of interest to government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and pharmacies, and all others involved in the provenance and authenticity of medicines and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.",

        "Title": "Survey and Taxonomy of Volunteer Computing",
        "Abstract": "Volunteer Computing is a kind of distributed computing that harnesses the aggregated spare computing resources of volunteer devices. It provides a cheaper and greener alternative computing infrastructure that can complement the dedicated, centralized, and expensive data centres. The aggregated idle computing resources of devices ranging from desktop computers to routers and smart TVs are being utilized to provide the much needed computing infrastructure for compute intensive tasks such as scientific simulations and big data analysis. However, the use of Volunteer Computing is still dominated by scientific applications and only a very small fraction of the potential volunteer nodes are participating. This article provides a comprehensive survey of Volunteer Computing, covering key technical and operational issues such as security, task distribution, resource management, and incentive models. The article also presents a taxonomy of Volunteer Computing systems, together with discussions of the characteristics of specific systems in each category. To harness the full potentials of Volunteer Computing and make it a reliable alternative computing infrastructure for general applications, we need to improve the existing techniques and device new mechanisms. Thus, this article also sheds light on important issues regarding the future research and development of Volunteer Computing systems with the aim of making them a viable alternative computing infrastructure.",

In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of over 2,300 articles to (a) identify the main components of CA research to date, and (b) explore the current gaps and future research directions. Through a Citation Network Analysis (CNA), we identified that there are currently three primary focus research areas on CA - Keystroke Dynamics; Mouse Movements; and Mobile Device Touch, as well as identify an emerging trend in more recent studies on multi-modal CA authentication which utilises the numerous sensors that are embedded in modern mobile devices. This study also highlights the current gaps in the literature such as the need for a consensus over how to evaluate the application and utility of CA, and the need to examine the feasibility of CA technologies that currently exist based on more use case studies.",

        "Abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data.",

IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution. Finally, we conclude this survey with an inherent discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.",

        "Title": "\"The Most Trustworthy Coin\": How Ideological Tensions Drive Trust in Bitcoin",
        "Abstract": "Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the \"True Bitcoiner\" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally \"trustless\" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this \"True Bitcoiner\" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts.",

        "Title": "A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues in Modern Healthcare Systems: Attacks and Defenses",
        "Abstract": "Recent advancements in computing systems and wireless communications have made healthcare systems more efficient than before. Modern healthcare devices can monitor and manage different health conditions of patients automatically without any manual intervention from medical professionals. Additionally, the use of implantable medical devices, body area networks, and Internet of Things technologies in healthcare systems improve the overall patient monitoring and treatment process. However, these systems are complex in software and hardware, and optimizing between security, privacy, and treatment is crucial for healthcare systems because any security or privacy violation can lead to severe effects on patients\u2019 treatments and overall health conditions. Indeed, the healthcare domain is increasingly facing security challenges and threats due to numerous design flaws and the lack of proper security measures in healthcare devices and applications. In this article, we explore various security and privacy threats to healthcare systems and discuss the consequences of these threats. We present a detailed survey of different potential attacks and discuss their impacts. Furthermore, we review the existing security measures proposed for healthcare systems and discuss their limitations. Finally, we conclude the article with future research directions toward securing healthcare systems against common vulnerabilities.",

        "Abstract": "The Device-as-a-service (DaaS) IoT business model enables distributed IoT devices to sell collected data to other devices, paving the way for machine-to-machine (M2M) economy applications. Cryptocurrencies are widely used by various IoT devices to undertake the main settlement and payment task in the M2M economy. However, the cryptocurrency market, which lacks effective supervision, has fluctuated wildly in the past few years. These fluctuations are breeding grounds for arbitrage in IoT data trading. Therefore, a practical cryptocurrency market supervision framework is very imperative in the process of IoT data trading to ensure that the trading is completed safely and fairly. The difficulty stems from how to combine these unlabeled daily trading data with supervision strategies to punish abnormal users, who disrupt the data trading market in IoT. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop hybrid supervision framework based on the unsupervised anomaly detection to solve this problem. The core is to design the multi-modal unsupervised anomaly detection methods on trading prices to identify malicious users. We then design a dedicated control strategy with three levels to defend against various abnormal behaviors, according to the detection results. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliability of this framework, we evaluate the detection rate, accuracy, Precision and time consumption of single-modal, multi-modal detection methods and the contrast algorithm Adaptive KDE [19]. Finally, an effective prototype framework for supervising is established. The extensive evaluations prove that our supervision framework greatly reduces IoT data trading risks and losses.",

        "Abstract": "Despite increasing awareness and research about online strategic information operations, there remain gaps in our understanding, including how information operations leverage the wider information ecosystem and take shape on and across multiple social media platforms. In this paper we use mixed methods, including digital trace ethnography, to look beyond a single social media platform to the broader information ecosystem. We aim to understand how multiple social media platforms are used, in parallel and complementary ways, to achieve the strategic goals of online information operations. We focus on a specific case study: the contested online conversation surrounding Syria Civil Defense (the White Helmets), a group of first responders that assists civilians affected by the civil war within the country. Our findings reveal a network of social media platforms from which content is produced, stored, and integrated into the Twitter conversation. We highlight specific activities that sustain the strategic narratives and attempt to influence the media agenda. And we note that underpinning these efforts is the work of resilience-building: the use of alternative (non-mainstream) platforms to counter perceived threats of 'censorship' by large, established social media platforms. We end by discussing the implications on social media platform policy.",

        "Title": "Cookie Banners and Privacy Policies: Measuring the Impact of the GDPR on the Web",
        "Abstract": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in effect since May of 2018. As one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation concerning privacy, it sparked a lot of discussion on the effect it would have on users and providers of online services in particular, due to the large amount of personal data processed in this context. Almost three years later, we are interested in revisiting this question to summarize the impact this new regulation has had on actors in the World Wide Web. Using Scopus, we obtain a vast corpus of academic work to survey studies related to changes on websites since and around the time the GDPR went into force. Our findings show that the emphasis on privacy increased w.r.t. online services, but plenty potential for improvements remains. Although online services are on average more transparent regarding data processing practices in their public data policies, a majority of these policies still either lack information required by the GDPR (e.g., contact information for users to file privacy inquiries) or do not provide this information in a user-friendly form. Additionally, we summarize that online services more often provide means for their users to opt out of data processing, but regularly obstruct convenient access to such means through unnecessarily complex and sometimes illegitimate interface design. Our survey further details that this situation contradicts the preferences expressed by users both verbally and through their actions, and researchers have proposed multiple approaches to facilitate GDPR-conform data processing without negatively impacting the user experience. Thus, we compiled reoccurring points of criticism by privacy researchers and data protection authorities into a list of four guidelines for service providers to consider.",

        "Title": "A Security Review in the UAVNet Era: Threats, Countermeasures, and Gap Analysis",
        "Abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming one of the main technological supports for commercial applications, embracing many domains ranging from human safety to the medical field, agriculture and environment, multimedia production, and even commercial delivery. This rise in popularity, however, is causing an increasing interest from criminals, making UAVs the target of new attacks. To fully characterize the current UAV cybersecurity landscape, we perform a complete literature review, digging into drone security historic facts and scientific studies on the matter, reviewing specialized articles and scientific papers focusing on cybersecurity threats and gaps in the context of small UAVs in commercial applications. Being a recent research and development area, most of the articles have been published between 2016 and 2020 as a direct consequence of the increase of security concerns and interest in the drone field. Papers in this review deal with UAV cyberthreats and related vulnerabilities, identifying flaws experimented in a lab or describing incidents detected in the field. Communication, sensors, and system misconfigurations are among the most important threat vectors, while sensor spoofing/jamming and malware DoS/control are among the most cited threats. Threat vectors permit depicting a complete overview of the topic and potential countermeasures known to date, with related gap analysis, also accounting for the recent Unmanned Aircraft System evolution toward ad hoc or cloud-based UAV networks. Countermeasures include the adoption of traditional communication encryption and standard protocols, GPS spoofing/jamming mitigation, encryption and privacy-aware implementations, and counter-malware techniques, to name the most adopted. It also emerges that often attacks are simply ported or adapted from other attacks in similar domains, while peculiar attacks still remain such as targeted physical attacks, specific UAV malware, and GPS spoofing/jamming.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the increasing connectivity among the various intelligent devices or systems, the control of access and fusion in smart factory networks has significantly gained importance. However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.",

Companies spend crucial resources to train personnel whose academic backgrounds are not only based on \u201ccomputing disciplines\u201d but also on non-computing ones. Analyzing the gap between the software industry and academia is important for three reasons: (1) for employers, hiring properly trained practitioners allows them to spend less time in training them while incorporating them more efficiently into the workforce; (2) for practitioners, knowing the most important skillset is helpful to increase their chance of employability; and (3) for academia, understanding the necessary skillset is critical to making curriculum changes. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey that yielded responses from 659 software professionals working worldwide in different roles. In this study, we only included the responses of 393 embedded software practitioners whose undergraduate degree was completed in Turkey, working in 10 countries. This article sheds light on the most important skills in the embedded software industry by presenting various cross-factor analyses. Understanding the coverage of these skills in the curriculum (mostly in Turkish universities) helps bridge the gaps, which can and should be achieved through more Industry Academia Collaborations (IACs).",

        "Title": "Dandelion: Redesigning the Bitcoin Network for Anonymity",
        "Abstract": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged in popularity over the last decade. Although Bitcoin does not claim to provide anonymity for its users, it enjoys a public perception of being a privacy preserving financial system. In reality, cryptocurrencies publish users' entire transaction histories in plaintext, albeit under a pseudonym; this is required for transaction validation. Therefore, if a user's pseudonym can be linked to their human identity, the privacy fallout can be significant. Recently, researchers have demonstrated deanonymization attacks that exploit weaknesses in the Bitcoin network's peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocols. In particular, the P2P network currently forwards content in a structured way that allows observers to deanonymize users. In this work, we redesign the P2P network from first principles with the goal of providing strong, provable anonymity guarantees. We propose a simple networking policy called Dandelion which provides quasi-optimal, network-wide anonymity, with minimal cost to the network's utility. We also discuss practical implementation challenges and propose heuristic solutions.",

        "Title": "Application Threats to Exploit Northbound Interface Vulnerabilities in Software Defined Networks",
        "Abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolving technology that decouples the control functionality from the underlying hardware managed by the control plane. The application plane supports programmers to develop numerous applications (such as networking, management, security, etc.) that can even be executed from remote locations. Northbound interface (NBI) bridges the control and application planes to execute the third-party applications business logic. Due to the software bugs in applications and existing vulnerabilities such as illegal function calling, resource exhaustion, lack of trust, and so on, NBIs are susceptible to different attacks. Based on the extensive literature review, we have identified that the researchers and academia have mainly focused on the security of the control plane, data plane, and southbound interface (SBI). NBI, in comparison, has received far less attention. In this article, the security of the least explored, but a critical component of the SDN architecture, i.e., NBI, is analyzed. The article provides a brief overview of SDN, followed by a detailed discussion on the categories of NBI, vulnerabilities of NBI, and threats posed by malicious applications to NBI. Efforts of the researchers to counter malicious applications and NBI issues are then discussed in detail. The standardization efforts for the single acceptable NBI and security requirements of SDN by Open Networking Foundation (ONF) are also presented. The article concludes with the future research directions for the security of a single acceptable NBI.",

The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the surging popularity of various cryptocurrencies in recent years, a large number of browser extensions have been developed as portals to access relevant services, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This has stimulated a wild growth of cryptocurrency themed malicious extensions that cause heavy financial losses to the users and legitimate service providers. They have shown their capability of evading the stringent vetting processes of the extension stores, highlighting a lack of understanding of this emerging type of malware in our community. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study to identify and characterize cryptocurrency-themed malicious extensions. We monitor seven official and third-party extension distribution venues for 18 months (December 2020 to June 2022) and have collected around 3600 unique cryptocurrency-themed extensions. Leveraging a hybrid analysis, we have identified 186 malicious extensions that belong to five categories. We then characterize those extensions from various perspectives including their distribution channels, life cycles, developers, illicit behaviors, and illegal gains. Our work unveils the status quo of the cryptocurrency-themed malicious extensions and reveals their disguises and programmatic features on which detection techniques can be based. Our work serves as a warning to extension users, and an appeal to extension store operators to enact dedicated countermeasures. To facilitate future research in this area, we release our dataset of the identified malicious extensions and open-source our analyzer.",

        "Abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), based on the Edge Computing motivation and fundamentals, is a promising technology supporting Intelligent Transport Systems services, smart city applications, and urban computing. VEC can provide and manage computational resources closer to vehicles and end-users, providing access to services at lower latency and meeting the minimum execution requirements for each service type. This survey describes VEC\u2019s concepts and technologies; we also present an overview of existing VEC architectures, discussing them and exemplifying them through layered designs. Besides, we describe the underlying vehicular communication in supporting resource allocation mechanisms. With the intent to overview the risks, breaches, and measures in VEC, we review related security approaches and methods. Finally, we conclude this survey work with an overview and study of VEC\u2019s main challenges. Unlike other surveys in which they are focused on content caching and data offloading, this work proposes a taxonomy based on the architectures in which VEC serves as the central element. VEC supports such architectures in capturing and disseminating data and resources to offer services aimed at a smart city through their aggregation and the allocation in a secure manner.",

        "Abstract": "Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the \"Ostrom Workshop.\" A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a \"constitutional layer\" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.",

However, due to massive terminologies and complex structures in a HDAG, an end user might feel difficult to explore and summarize the whole graph, which is practically useful but less studied in the literature. In this demo, we develop an interactive system of HDAG-Explorer to help users summarize HDAG with highly important and diverse vertices. Our HDAG-Explorer system exhibits several useful features including summarized visualization, interactive exploration, and structural statistics report. All these features facilitate in-depth understanding of the HDAG data. We showcase the usability of the HDAG-Explorer through two real-world applications of summarized topic recommendation and visual data exploration.",

New technologies have been proposed and existing approaches optimised to meet user, society and industry requirements. However, as the complexity and heterogeneity of the traffic that flows through the networks are continuously growing, the innovation becomes difficult to achieve in both IoT and legacy networks. This article provides an overview of IoT application domains from a traffic characteristics perspective. Specifically, it identifies several groups of major IoT application use cases and discusses the exhibited traffic characteristics, used network technologies for implementation, and their feasibility as well as challenges. We stress that a key factor in future IoT development is network technologies and the way they handle and forward network traffic. The traffic characteristics emerging from this work can serve as a basis for future design proposals to develop more efficient solutions and improve the network technologies.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI technology has been widely used in various fields of social and economic life, bringing great impact to various industries. AI is a section of computer science, a new science technology that studies and develops theories, methods, and application systems used. The development of artificial intelligence technology first has a profound impact on the development of the accounting industry, which leads to the change of the demand for accounting talents. This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students\u2019 experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields. An in-depth study of the challenges of artificial intelligence technology to accounting education is also of reference and guiding significance for the reform and development of engineering education and other fields.",

The growing number of research initiatives and creative applications that emerge in the intersection of AI and art motivates us to examine and discuss the creative and explorative potentials of AI technologies in the context of art. This article provides an integrated review of two facets of AI and art: (1) AI is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections, or (2) AI is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of AI-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, and computational aesthetics, among others. In relation to the role of AI in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of AI Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail. Finally, we provide a concise outlook on the future progression and potential impact of AI technologies on our understanding and creation of art.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we share our experiences in designing and developing a suite of deep neural network\u2013(DNN) based COVID-19 case detection and recognition framework. Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level. Existing research has shown that DNN has been successful in identifying COVID-19 from radiological media such as CT scans and X-ray images, audio media such as cough sounds, optical coherence tomography to identify conjunctivitis and pink eye symptoms on the ocular surface, body temperature measurement using smartphone fingerprint sensors or thermal cameras, the use of live facial detection to identify safe social distancing practices from camera images, and face mask detection from camera images. We also investigate the utility of federated learning in diagnosis cases where private data can be trained via edge learning. These point-of-care modalities can be integrated with DNN-based RT-PCR laboratory test results to assimilate multiple modalities of COVID-19 detection and thereby provide more dimensions of diagnosis. Finally, we will present our initial test results, which are encouraging.",

        "Abstract": "The proliferation of heterogeneous Internet of things (IoT) devices connected to the Internet produces several operational and security challenges, such as monitoring, detecting, and recognizing millions of interconnected IoT devices. Network and system administrators must correctly identify which devices are functional, need security updates, or are vulnerable to specific attacks. IoT profiling is an emerging technique to identify and validate the connected devices\u2019 specific behaviour and isolate the suspected and vulnerable devices within the network for further monitoring. This article provides a comprehensive review of various IoT device profiling methods and provides a clear taxonomy for IoT profiling techniques based on different security perspectives. We first investigate several current IoT device profiling techniques and their applications. Next, we analyzed various IoT device vulnerabilities, outlined multiple features, and provided detailed information to implement profiling algorithms\u2019 risk assessment/mitigation stage. By reviewing approaches for profiling IoT devices, we identify various state-of-the-art methods that organizations of different domains can implement to satisfy profiling needs. Furthermore, this article also discusses several machine learning and deep learning algorithms utilized for IoT device profiling. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research possibilities in this domain.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to support such new applications and handle the increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches and promising research directions.",

However, a malicious cloud server may prevent industrial participants from acquiring accurate traceability of items by providing inconsistent item data. To fix this issue, we propose Acics, an item data consistency auditing scheme in untrusted cloud services for cloud-aided IIoT systems. Acics presents two variants named S-Acics and L-Acics. S-Acics enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for each item and circularly play the auditing role. L-Acics further enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for a sampled subset of items while resisting data selection attack via a new separated storage mechanism. Finally, Acics integrates a fair payment mechanism built on smart contract to incentivize the cloud server to provide consistent item data access service for industrial participants. The experiment results show that our solution can audit item data consistency with reasonable cost.",

        "Abstract": "Applications in diverse domains such as astronomy, economics and industrial monitoring, increasingly press the need for analyzing massive collections of time series data. The sheer size of the latter hinders our ability to efficiently store them and also yields significant storage costs. Applying general purpose compression algorithms would effectively reduce the size of the data, at the expense of introducing significant computational overhead. Time Series Management Systems that have emerged to address the challenge of handling this overwhelming amount of information, cannot suffer the ingestion rate restrictions that such compression algorithms would cause. Data points are usually encoded using faster, streaming compression approaches. However, the techniques that contemporary systems use do not fully utilize the compression potential of time series data, with implications in both storage requirements and access times. In this work, we propose a novel streaming compression algorithm, suitable for floating point time series data. We empirically establish properties exhibited by a diverse set of time series and harness these features in our proposed encodings. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach readily outperforms competing techniques, attaining compression ratios that are competitive with slower general purpose algorithms, and on average around 50% of the space required by state-of-the-art streaming approaches. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms all earlier techniques with regards to both compression and access time, offering a significantly improved trade-off between space and speed. The aforementioned benefits of our approach - in terms of all space requirements, compression time and read access - significantly improve the efficiency in which we can store and analyze time series data.",

        "Title": "A Tale of Two Entities: Contextualizing the Security of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations on the Power Grid",
        "Abstract": "With the growing market of Electric Vehicles (EV), the procurement of their charging infrastructure plays a crucial role in their adoption. Within the revolution of Internet of Things, the EV charging infrastructure is getting on board with the introduction of smart Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS), a myriad set of communication protocols, and different entities. We provide in this article an overview of this infrastructure detailing the participating entities and the communication protocols. Further, we contextualize the current deployment of EVCSs through the use of available public data. In the light of such a survey, we identify two key concerns, the lack of standardization and multiple points of failures, which renders the current deployment of EV charging infrastructure vulnerable to an array of different attacks. Moreover, we propose a novel attack scenario that exploits the unique characteristics of the EVCSs and their protocol (such as high power wattage and support for reverse power flow) to cause disturbances to the power grid. We investigate three different attack variations; sudden surge in power demand, sudden surge in power supply, and a switching attack. To support our claims, we showcase using a real-world example how an adversary can compromise an EVCS and create a traffic bottleneck by tampering with the charging schedules of EVs. Further, we perform a simulation-based study of the impact of our proposed attack variations on the WSCC 9 bus system. Our simulations show that an adversary can cause devastating effects on the power grid, which might result in blackout and cascading failure by comprising a small number of EVCSs.",

        "Title": "Access Control Mechanisms in Named Data Networks: A Comprehensive Survey",
        "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.",

        "Title": "Privacy-preserving Crowd-sensed Trust Aggregation in the User-centeric Internet of People Networks",
        "Abstract": "Today we are relying on Internet technologies for numerous services, for example, personal communication, online businesses, recruitment, and entertainment. Over these networks, people usually create content, a skillful worker profile, and provide services that are normally watched and used by other users, thus developing a social network among people termed as the Internet of People. Malicious users could also utilize such platforms for spreading unwanted content that could bring catastrophic consequences to a social network provider and the society, if not identified on time. The use of trust management over these networks plays a vital role in the success of these services. Crowd-sensing people or network users for their views about certain content or content creators could be a potential solution to assess the trustworthiness of content creators and their content. However, the human involvement in crowd-sensing would have challenges of privacy preservation and preventing intentional assignment of the fake high score given to certain user/content. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel trust model that evaluates the aggregate trustworthiness of the content creator and the content without compromising the privacy of the participating people in a crowdsource group. The proposed system has inherent properties of privacy protection of participants, performs operations in the decentralized setup, and considers the trust weights of participants in a private and secure way. The system ensures privacy of participants under the malicious and honest-but-curious adversarial models. We evaluated the performance of the system by developing a prototype and applying it to different real data from different online social networks.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous increment of city volume and size, a number of traffic-related urban units (e.g., vehicles, roads, buildings, etc.) are emerging rapidly, which plays a heavy burden on the scientific traffic control of smart cities. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to utilize the sensor data from massive cameras deployed at city crossings for accurate traffic flow prediction. However, the traffic sensor data are often distributed and stored by different organizations or parties with zero trust, which impedes the multi-party sensor data sharing significantly due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it requires challenging efforts to balance the tradeoff between data sharing and data privacy to enable cross-organization traffic data fusion and prediction. In light of this challenge, we put forward an accurate LSH (locality-sensitive hashing)-based traffic flow prediction approach with the ability to protect privacy. Finally, through a series of experiments deployed on a real-world traffic dataset, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing sensor data privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Smart city infrastructures such as transportation and energy networks are evolving into so-called cyber physical social systems (CPSSs), which collect and leverage citizens\u2019 data in order to adapt services to citizens\u2019 needs. The privacy implications of such systems are, however, significant and need to be addressed. Current systems either try to escape the privacy challenge via anonymization or use very rigid, hard-coded workflows that have been agreed with a data protection authority. In the case of the latter, there is a severe impact on data quality and richness, whereas in the former, only these hard-coded flows are permitted resulting in diminished functionality and potential. We address these limitations via user modeling in terms of investigating how to model and semantically represent user consent, preferences, and data usage policies that will guide the processing of said data in the data lake. Data protection is a horizontal field and consequently very wide. Therefore, we focus on a concrete setting where we extend the domain-agnostic SPECIAL policy language for a smart mobility use case supplied by Vienna\u2019s largest utility provider. To that end, (1) we create an extension of SPECIAL in terms of a core CPSS vocabulary that lowers the semantic gap between the domain agnostic terms of SPECIAL and the vocabulary of the use case; (2) we propose a workflow that supports defining domain-specific vocabularies for complex CPSSs; and (3) show that these two contributions allow successfully achieving the goals of our setting.",

Research in the recommender system field has traditionally focused on the accuracy of predictions and the relevance of recommendations. However, other recommendation quality measures may have a significant impact on the overall performance of a recommender system and the satisfaction of users. Hence, researchers\u2019 attention in this field has recently shifted to include other recommender system objectives. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on recommender systems based on the objectives achieved: relevance, diversity, novelty, coverage, and serendipity. In addition, the definitions and measures associated with these objectives are reviewed. Furthermore, the article surveys the evaluation methodology used to measure the impact of the main challenges on performance and the new applications of the recommender system. Finally, new perspectives, open issues, and future directions are provided to develop the field.",

        "Abstract": "Within cloud computing containerization has become ubiquitous. As the availability of pre-built containers increases there is a need for methods capable of efficiently securing large repositories of software containers. We present a \u201cTrustworthy Container Repository\u201d (TCR) system which provides security assurances (confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity) regarding such a repository in a scalable manner. Trust within the TCR architecture is rooted in a low-complexity, tamper-resistant trusted module, which leverages index-ordered Merkle trees (IOMTs) to efficiently track a large number of container images and provide assurances of repository integrity to its users. The key contributions of the study are, identification of the required security model, a novel TCR data-structure, and verifiable algorithms to operate on it. Through experiment, we observe closely logarithmic time complexity of the proposed system up to a high container count (N = 225 \u2248 107).",

        "Title": "Data and Spectrum Trading Policies in a Trusted Cognitive Dynamic Network Architecture",
        "Abstract": "Future wireless networks will progressively displace service provisioning towards the edge to accommodate increasing growth in traffic. This paradigm shift calls for smart policies to efficiently share network resources and ensure service delivery. In this paper, we consider a cognitive dynamic network architecture CDNA where primary users PUs are rewarded for sharing their connectivities and acting as access points for secondary users SUs. CDNA creates opportunities for capacity increase by network-wide harvesting of unused data plans and spectrum from different operators. Different policies for data and spectrum trading are presented based on centralized, hybrid, and distributed schemes involving primary operator PO, secondary operator SO, and their respective end users. In these schemes, PO and SO progressively delegate trading to their end users and adopt more flexible cooperation agreements to reduce computational time and track available resources dynamically. A novel matching-with-pricing algorithm is presented to enable self-organized SU-PU associations, channel allocation and pricing for data and spectrum with low computational complexity. Since connectivity is provided by the actual users, the success of the underlying collaborative market relies on the trustworthiness of the connections. A behavioral-based access control mechanism is developed to incentivize/penalize honest/dishonest behavior and create a trusted collaborative network. Numerical results show that the computational time of the hybrid scheme is one order of magnitude faster than the benchmark centralized scheme and that the matching algorithm reconfigures the network up to three orders of magnitude faster than in the centralized scheme.",

        "Abstract": "This paper focuses on network resilience to perturbation of edge weight. Other than connectivity, many network applications nowadays rely upon some measure of network distance between a pair of connected nodes. In these systems, a metric related to network functionality is associated to each edge. A pair of nodes only being functional if the weighted, shortest-path distance between the pair is below a given threshold T. Consequently, a natural question is on which degree the change of edge weights can damage the network functionality? With this motivation, we study a new problem, Quality of Service Degradation : given a set of pairs, find a minimum budget to increase the edge weights which ensures the distance between each pair exceeds T . We introduce four algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees for this problem. Each of them has its own strength in trade-off between effectiveness and running time, which are illustrated both in theory and comprehensive experimental evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents Scalar DL, a Byzantine fault detection (BFD) middleware for transactional database systems. Scalar DL manages two separately administered database replicas in a database system and can detect Byzantine faults in the database system as long as either replica is honest (not faulty). Unlike previous BFD works, Scalar DL executes non-conflicting transactions in parallel while preserving a correctness guarantee. Moreover, Scalar DL is database-agnostic middleware so that it achieves the detection capability in a database system without either modifying the databases or using database-specific mechanisms. Experimental results with YCSB and TPC-C show that Scalar DL outperforms a state-of-the-art BFD system by 3.5 to 10.6 times in throughput and works effectively on multiple database implementations. We also show that Scalar DL achieves near-linear (91%) scalability when the number of nodes composing each replica increases.",

        "Title": "Monetizing Spare Bandwidth: The Case of Distributed VPNs",
        "Abstract": "Residential Internet speeds have been rapidly increasing, reaching averages of ~100 Mbps in most developed countries. Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer's cost and seller's income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc \"rules-of-thumb\" when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller's income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.",

        "Abstract": "The role of wearable technology in our daily lives is rapidly growing and many users are cumulatively becoming dependent on it. To provide insight into the future of wearable technologies and various community attitudes towards them, we implemented an in-depth quantitative investigation of opinions from academic texts (DBLP and PubMed), social media (Twitter), news media (Google News and Bing News), and entrepreneurship communities (Kickstarter and Indiegogo) over a 10-year period. Our results indicate that unlike academia, the news media, entrepreneurship communities, and social media all hold overall positive attitudes towards wearable technologies. Secondly, there are diverse perspectives towards various wearable products across different platforms. Specifically, \"XR\" technologies received the most attention, while \"Exoskeleton\" ignited the most heated debates. Thirdly, we discovered that the lifetime of a hyped wearable technology lasts approximately three years. Furthermore, the news media and entrepreneurship community's attitudes towards wearable technologies did not have a strong impact on public opinion. Finally, among all types of wearable technologies, \"fashion design\" and \"healthcare\" products were the most enlightening for the market.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in personalization of digital services are driven by low-cost data collection and processing, in addition to the wide variety of third-party frameworks for authentication, storage, and marketing. New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing. Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal consent framework to support organizations, data users and data subjects in their understanding of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include: (i) a formal framework to reason about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios; (ii) a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different scenarios; (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve their policies using this framework; and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework. The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy violations as data practices evolve in real-time. The framework was evaluated using the five use cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model of data collection and access, and practice and policy evolution.",

        "Abstract": "The microgrid (MG) is a complicated cyber-physical system that operates based on interactions between physical processes and computational components, which make it vulnerable to varied cyber-attacks. In this paper, the impact of data integrity attack (DIA) has been considered, as one of the most dangerous cyber threats to MGs, on the steady-state operation of hybrid MGs (HMGs). Additionally, a novel method based on sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) approach, is proposed to detect DIA on the renewable energy sources\u2019 metering infrastructure and improve the data security within the HMGs. The proposed method generates a binary sample, which is used to compute a test statistic that is further used against two thresholds to decide among three alternatives. The performance of the suggested method is examined using an IEEE standard test system. The results illustrated the acceptable performance of the proposed methodology in detection of DIAs. Also, to evaluate the effect of DIA on the operation of the HMGs, DIAs with different severities are launched on the measured power generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) like wind turbine (WT). The results of this part showed that a successful DIA on renewable units can severely affect the operation of electric grids and cause serious damages.",

        "Abstract": "The name edge intelligence, also known as Edge AI, is a recent term used in the past few years to refer to the confluence of machine learning, or broadly speaking artificial intelligence, with edge computing. In this article, we revise the concepts regarding edge intelligence, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, the motivation to use edge intelligence, and compare current approaches and analyze application scenarios. To provide a complete review of this technology, previous frameworks and platforms for edge computing have been discussed in this work to provide the general view of the basis for Edge AI. Similarly, the emerging techniques to deploy deep learning models at the network edge, as well as specialized platforms and frameworks to do so, are review in this article. These devices, techniques, and frameworks are analyzed based on relevant criteria at the network edge, such as latency, energy consumption, and accuracy of the models, to determine the current state of the art as well as current limitations of the proposed technologies. Because of this, it is possible to understand the current possibilities to efficiently deploy state-of-the-art deep learning models at the network edge based on technologies such as artificial intelligence accelerators, tensor processing units, and techniques that include federated learning and gossip training. Finally, the challenges of Edge AI are discussed in the work, as well as the future directions that can be extracted from the evolution of the edge computing and Internet of Things approaches.",

        "Title": "Carpooling in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: Current Solutions and Future Directions",
        "Abstract": "Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.",

        "Abstract": "Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document, but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using 1) the evolving focus time of news articles, 2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With semi-supervised learning and lexicon expansion, the result of the developed model can achieve 89%. The method performed better than previous baselines and traditional machine learning models with improvements of 12.65% and 4.7%, respectively.",

However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application. In addition, there exist varying levels of uncertainty associated with an evidence upon which a trust model is built. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms require some provisions to adapt to different risk attitudes and uncertainties.",

        "Title": "Detection and Mitigation of DoS Attacks in Software Defined Networks",
        "Abstract": "The introduction of software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a new network paradigm for network innovations. By decoupling the control plane from the data plane in traditional networks, SDN provides high programmability to control and manage networks. However, the communication between the two planes can be a bottleneck of the whole network. SDN-aimed DoS attacks can cause long packet delay and high packet loss rate by using massive table-miss packets to jam links between the two planes. To detect and mitigate SDN-aimed DoS attacks, this paper presents FloodDefender, an efficient and protocol-independent defense framework for SDN/OpenFlow networks. FloodDefender stands between the controller platform and other controller apps, and conforms to the OpenFlow policy without additional devices. The detection module in FloodDefender utilizes new frequency features to precisely identify SDN-aimed DoS attacks. The mitigation module uses three new techniques to efficiently mitigate attack traffic: table-miss engineering to prevent the communication bandwidth from being exhausted; packet filter to filter out attack traffic and save computational resources of the control plane; and flow rule management to eliminate most of useless flow entries in the switch flow table. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of FloodDefender shows that the defense framework can precisely identify and efficiently mitigate the SDN-aimed DoS attacks with very little overhead.",

        "Abstract": "Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors\u2019 experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people\u2019s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

Formerly, end-users were targeted via mass infection campaigns. Nevertheless, in recent years, the attackers have focused on targeted attacks, since the latter are profitable and can induce severe damage. A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware\u2019s battle.",

Because of this, data hiding approaches have received much attention in several application areas. However, those approaches are unable to solve many issues that are necessary to measure in future investigations. This survey provides a comprehensive survey on data hiding techniques and their new trends for solving new challenges in real-world applications. The notable applications are telemedicine, 3D objects, mobile devices, cloud/distributed computing and data mining environments, chip and hardware protection, cyber physical systems, internet traffic, fusion of watermarking and encryption, joint compression and watermarking, biometric watermarking, watermarking at the physical layer, and many other perspectives. Further, the potential issues that existing approaches of data hiding face are identified. I believe that this survey will provide a valuable source of information for finding research directions for fledgling researchers and developers.",

The increasing number of sensors collects a large amount of city data across multiple domains. The collected data have great potential value, but has not yet been fully exploited. This survey focuses on the domains of transportation, environment, emergency and public safety, energy, and social sensing. This article carefully reviews both the data sets being collected across 14 smart cities and the state-of-the-art work in modeling and decision making methodologies. The article also points out the characteristics, challenges faced today, and those challenges that will be exacerbated in the future. Key data issues addressed include heterogeneity, interdisciplinary, integrity, completeness, real-timeliness, and interdependencies. Key decision making issues include safety and service conflicts, security, uncertainty, humans in the loop, and privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Air pollution is a serious global issue impacting public health and social economy. In particular, exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancer. Fine-grained urban air quality monitoring is crucial yet difficult to achieve. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an ambient environment aware system, namely UbiAir, which can support fine-grained urban air quality monitoring through mobile crowdsensing on a bike-sharing system. We have built specific IoT box configured with multiple pollutant sensors and attached on shared bikes to sample micro-scale air quality data in the monitoring space that is split by a scalable grid structure. Both hardware and software data calibration methods are exploited in UbiAir to make the sampled data reliable. Then, we use Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) as an inference model that leverages the calibrated samples to recover data points without direct measurements and reconstruct an accurate air quality map covering the entire monitoring space. In addition, red envelope based incentive schemes and differential rewarding strategies have been designed in UbiAir, and an adaptive BCS algorithm is proposed to deploy the red envelopes at the most informative positions to facilitate data sampling and inference. We have tested our system on campus with over 100k data measurements collected by 36 students through 18 days. Our real-world experiments show that UbiAir is a light-weight, low-cost, accurate and scalable system for fine-grained air quality monitoring, as compared with other solutions.",

Checking the validity of a certificate involves three steps: (i) checking its expiration date, (ii) verifying its signature, and (iii) ensuring that it is not revoked. Currently, such certificate revocation checks (i.e., step (iii) above) are done either via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) servers. Unfortunately, despite the existence of these revocation checks, sophisticated cyber-attackers can still trick web browsers to trust a revoked certificate, believing that it is still valid.",

In recent years, an image compression scheme has been widely considered; such a scheme saves on hardware storage space and lowers both the transmission time and bandwidth demand for various potential applications. In this article, we review the various approaches taken to consider joint encryption and compression, assessing both their merits and their limitations. In addition to the survey, we also briefly introduce the most interesting and most often utilized applications of image encryption and evaluation metrics, providing an overview of the various kinds of image encryption schemes available. The contribution made by these approaches is then summarized and compared, offering a consideration of the different technical perspectives. Lastly, we highlight the recent challenges and some potential research directions that could fill the gaps in these domains for both researchers and developers.",

        "Abstract": "Responding to NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's call to double the number of students graduating with a Bachelors degrees in computer science, in 2017, the Tech-in-Residence Corps (TIRC) program, first-of-its-kind multi stakeholder partnership between academia, government, and private industry, was established at the City University of New York. The TIRC program quickly led to a rethinking of the potential roles that industry adjuncts can take on within CS Departments. Its driving hypothesis was that by employing a coordinated campaign to recruit top-quality industry practitioners to not only teach students advanced applied topics directly, but also provide feedback on curriculum development, this would enable campus departments to align better with industry practices. In addition, industry adjuncts explored opportunities within their companies for student internships and full-time entry-level jobs, with the hope that this would increase students' job competitiveness. Ultimately, this created a sustained feedback loop that lead to other mutually beneficial arrangements between the tech industry and the university's CS Departments. This panel discussion will represent the different perspectives of various stakeholders who have directly participated in the Tech-in-Residence Corps program: department faculty, an industry adjunct, the TIRC program manager, and a university administrator.",

While modern information technologies provide the necessary underpinnings expressed by the terms \u201cdigital\u201d or the outdated \u201celectronic,\u201d for this public-sector phenomenon, technology in and by itself is not sufficient to capture the scope and various dimensions of Digital Government, which, unobserved at first, and later even disputed, continue to have increasingly transformational influences on the business of government in all its aspects, on all levels, and in all branches. In this disquisition, the evolution of Digital Government is portrayed and discussed from its humble beginnings to the intermediary present along with a projection and a preview of where this fascinating multidisciplinary domain of research and practice might lead in the next two decades. It is claimed that the transformation of the business of government is just beginning, and it is argued that major and undeniable instances of transition can be observed in the next decade.",

        "Abstract": "Technological artifacts can be collected as evidence, used by investigators, or misused by suspects. The presented assignment is aligned with one of several topics covered in introduction to digital forensics, a required course for students either majoring or minoring in cybersecurity. The assignment consists of three different components: a technology component, a legal case study, and a research component. The assignment combines computing topics related to digital forensics with criminal justice topics that are related to actual legal cases with at least one piece of digital forensic evidence. The students will also research a topic related to the role of technology in a digital forensics investigation to expand their knowledge beyond the scope of the course.",

        "Abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is designed to refine and optimize the process controls, thereby leveraging improvements in economic benefits, such as efficiency and productivity. However, the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in an IIoT environment has problems such as low security and high cost. To overcome such issues, a mutual authentication scheme that is suitable for RFID systems, wherein techniques in Deep Learning (DL) are incorporated onto the Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (APUF) for the secured access authentication of the IC circuits on the IoT, is proposed. The design applies the APUF-MPUF mutual authentication structure obtained by DL to generate essential real-time authentication information, thereby taking advantage of the feature that the tag in the PUF circuit structure does not need to store any essential information and resolving the problem of key storage. The proposed scheme also uses a bitwise comparison method, which hides the PUF response information and effectively reduces the resource overhead of the system during the verification process, to verify the correctness of the two strings. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has high robustness and security against different conventional attack methods, and the storage and communication costs are 95.7% and 42.0% lower than the existing schemes, respectively.",

        "Title": "Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence: A Machine Learning Perspective",
        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning (ML), a branch of AI which has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this paper, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this paper can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.",

        "Abstract": "Nature-inspired optimization is one of the most prevalent research domains with a confounding history that fascinates the research communities. Particle Swarm Optimization is one of the well-known optimizers that belongs to the family of nature-inspired algorithms. It often suffers from premature convergence leading to a local optimum. To address this, several methods were presented using different network topologies of the particles, but either lacked accuracy or were slow. To solve these problems, an improved version of the Directed Weighted Complex Network Particle Swarm Optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (GDWCN-PSO) is presented. This method uses the concept of the Genetic Algorithm after each update to enhance convergence and diversity. Since most of the real-world applications and complex optimization problems involve more than one objective function so to suit this problem, a multiobjective version of GDWCN-PSO is also proposed and validated on standard benchmarks. To demonstrate its applicability in real-world applications, GDWCN-PSO is applied to solve the optimal key-based medical image encryption. It is one of the most challenging problems in health IoTs for protecting sensitive and confidential patient data as well as addressing the major concern of integrity and security of data in today\u2019s advanced digital world.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought unprecedented opportunities to meet massive behavioral data access and personalization requirements for Internet of Behavior (IoB). They facilitate the communication and computing resource allocation to guarantee low delay and energy consumption demands in healthcare. This article presents an improved offloading algorithm for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based on Deep Q Network (DQN) and Simulated Annealing (SA) for IoB. Firstly, we analyze the network model and establish a task cost function based on processing delay and energy consumption. Secondly, we define a Distributed Optimization Problem (DOP) to maximize individual utilities and system utility, which is proved to be a potential countermeasure. Thirdly, we conduct Markov modeling for the current offloading strategy-making scheme and define the objectives and constraints of the optimization function. At the same time, the SA is introduced into the DQN Algorithm, which improves the capacity of the algorithm by focusing on the exploration in the early stage and following the experience value in the later stage. From the simulation results, we can see that compared with the traditional scheme, the proposed strategy can maximize the utilization of the system and reduce processing delay and energy consumption.",

        "Title": "The Invisible Side of Certificate Transparency: Exploring the Reliability of Monitors in the Wild",
        "Abstract": "To detect fraudulent TLS server certificates and improve the accountability of certification authorities (CAs), certificate transparency (CT) is proposed to record certificates in publicly-visible logs, from which the monitors fetch all certificates and watch for suspicious ones. However, if the monitors, either domain owners themselves or third-party services, fail to return a complete set of certificates issued for a domain of interest, potentially fraudulent certificates may not be detected and then the CT framework becomes less reliable. This paper presents the first systematic study on CT monitors. We analyze the data in 88 public logs and the services of 5 active third-party monitors regarding 3,000,431 certificates of 6,000 selected Alexa Top-1M websites. We find that although CT allows ordinary domain owners to act as monitors, it is impractical for them to perform reliable processing by themselves, due to the rapidly increasing volume of certificates in public logs (e.g., on average about 5 million records or 28.29 GB daily for the minimal set of logs that need to be monitored in 2018, or more than 7 million records per day in 2020, according to the Chrome CT policy). Moreover, our study discloses that (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${a}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) none of the third-party monitors guarantees to return the complete set of certificates for a domain, and (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${b}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) for some domains, even the union of the certificates returned by the five third-party monitors can probably be incomplete. As a result, the certificates accepted by CT-enabled browsers are not actually visible to the claimed domain owners, even when CT is adopted with well-functioning logs. The risk of invisible fraudulent certificates in public logs raises doubts on the reliability of CT in practice.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces and describes a novel architecture scenario based on Cloud Computing and counts on the innovative model of Federated Learning. The proposed model is named Integrated Federated Model, with the acronym InFeMo. InFeMo incorporates all the existing Cloud models with a federated learning scenario, as well as other related technologies that may have integrated use with each other, offering a novel integrated scenario. In addition to this, the proposed model is motivated to deliver a more energy efficient system architecture and environment for the users, which aims to the scope of data management. Also, by applying the InFeMo the user would have less waiting time in every procedure queue. The proposed system was built on the resources made available by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and by using the PaaS (Platform as a Service) model, in order to be able to handle user requests better and faster. This research tries to fill a scientific gap in the field of federated Cloud systems. Thus, taking advantage of the existing scenarios of FedAvg and CO-OP, we were keen to end up with a new federated scenario that merges these two algorithms, and aiming for a more efficient model that is able to select, depending on the occasion, if it \u201ctrains\u201d the model locally in client or globally in server.",

        "Abstract": "Technology trend analysis uses data relevant to historical performance and extrapolates it to estimate and assess the future potential of technology. Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information.",

Fine-grained provenance further enables sophisticated reasoning about why individual output results appear or fail to appear.

We study this problem, developing solutions for storing fine-grained provenance in relational storage systems while both compressing and protecting it via cryptographic hashes.

        "Abstract": "Desynchronization is a very challenging type of attack in audio watermarking. The traditional singular value decomposition (SVD) based audio watermarking methods embed the watermark information by modifying the singular value of individual segment, which have little resistance against desynchronization attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency singular value coefficient (FSVC) feature, which reflects the ratio between the singular values of two consecutive segments and is insensitive to desynchronization attacks, to carry the watermark bits. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that the ratio between singular values is employed for audio watermarking. In the proposed method, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is performed on two consecutive segments of the host audio signal and SVD is applied to the DCT coefficients of the mid frequency band of each segment to extract the FSVC. Then the watermark bits are embedded by adjusting the values of the FSVC. The watermark embedding procedure is optimized to minimize the perceptual quality degradation and an error buffer is created to enhance the robustness. As a result, the proposed method can achieve a much higher embedding capacity than the existing methods tackling desynchronization attacks. The impact of desynchronization and common signal processing attacks on the proposed watermarking method is mathematically modeled, and the effectiveness of the proposed method against these attacks is theoretically and experimentally validated.",

        "Abstract": "How to combine multiple data-streams for transmission in aggregate is a very interesting problem, especially for the emerging software-defined networks nowadays. The conventional packet-based protocols cannot provide the flexibility for combining data-streams in the ad hoc nature. If the number of data-streams changes over time, the existing packet formats cannot handle the transmission of multiple data-streams effectively. The effectiveness is measured by two performance metrics, namely coding efficiency and data-transmission intermittency. We propose a new software-defined multiplexing code (SDMC) approach, which can combine (multiplex) multiple data-streams easily and is much more effective than the conventional packet-based method. Three SDMC schemes (distributed, hierarchical, and hybrid) are compared theoretically and by simulation. A trade-off between these two performance metrics can be found when one selects one of the three SDMC schemes for combining multiple data-streams. The hierarchical SDMC scheme brings about the highest coding efficiency while the hybrid SDMC scheme suffers from the smallest overall intermittency.",

        "Abstract": "How to combine multiple data-streams for transmission in aggregate is a very interesting problem, especially for the emerging software-defined networks nowadays. The conventional packet-based protocols cannot provide the flexibility for combining data-streams in the ad hoc nature. If the number of data-streams changes over time, the existing packet formats cannot handle the transmission of multiple data-streams effectively. The effectiveness is measured by two performance metrics, namely coding efficiency and data-transmission intermittency. We propose a new software-defined multiplexing code (SDMC) approach, which can combine (multiplex) multiple data-streams easily and is much more effective than the conventional packet-based method. Three SDMC schemes (distributed, hierarchical, and hybrid) are compared theoretically and by simulation. A trade-off between these two performance metrics can be found when one selects one of the three SDMC schemes for combining multiple data-streams. The hierarchical SDMC scheme brings about the highest coding efficiency while the hybrid SDMC scheme suffers from the smallest overall intermittency.",

        "Abstract": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most widely used in-vehicle communication protocol, which still lacks the implementation of suitable security mechanisms such as message authentication and encryption. This makes the CAN bus vulnerable to numerous cyber attacks. Various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been developed to detect these attacks. However, the high generalization capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) make AI-based IDS an excellent countermeasure against automotive cyber attacks. This article surveys AI-based in-vehicle IDS over the period of 2016-2022 (August) with a novel taxonomy. It reviews the detection techniques, attack types, features, and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the paper discusses the security of AI models, necessary steps to develop AI-based IDSs in the CAN bus, identifies the limitations of existing proposals and gives recommendations for future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices are becoming integrated into a significant and increasing proportion of critical infrastructures, changing the cybersecurity-risk landscape. Risk is being introduced to industry sectors such as transport, energy, and manufacturing, with new attack surfaces exposed and potential for increased harm. Furthermore, risk and harm arising in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) could propagate across interconnected organisations and sectors, resulting in systemic risk. Aspects of this changing risk landscape are not addressed by current cybersecurity approaches, leaving cybersecurity-capability gaps. In this article, we show how current and emerging cybersecurity needs in the IIoT align with a key industry cybersecurity standard, the NIST Cyber Security Framework. The key capability gaps emerging in the IIoT are identified based on our findings from a series of workshops with over 100 expert participants. We present a comprehensive research agenda to enable researchers to prioritise research focus to address these gaps; this research agenda covers the full lifecycle of IIoT development (design, implementation, use and decommission). Furthermore, we conclude that there is a significant gap in understanding of the nature of systemic risk, which should be a key priority if we are to develop effective solutions for cybersecurity and safety in IIoT environments.",

In this paper, we define the \"relative value of data\" via the Shapley value, as it uniquely possesses properties with appealing real-world interpretations, such as fairness, rationality and decentralizability. For general, bounded utility functions, the Shapley value is known to be challenging to compute: to get Shapley values for all N data points, it requires O(2N) model evaluations for exact computation and O(N log N) for (\u03f5, \u03b4)-approximation.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid development of modern artificial intelligence technique is mainly attributed to sufficient and high-quality data. However, in the data collection, personal privacy is at risk of being leaked. This issue can be addressed by federated learning, which is proposed to achieve efficient model training among multiple data providers without direct data access and aggregation. To encourage more parties owning high-quality data to participate in the federated learning, it is important to evaluate and reward the participant contribution in a reasonable, robust, and efficient manner. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel contribution estimation method: Intrinsic Performance Influence-based Contribution Estimation (IPICE). In particular, the class-level intrinsic performance influence is adopted as the contribution estimation criteria in IPICE, and a neural network is employed to exploit the non-linear relationship between the performance change and estimated contribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the results demonstrate that IPICE is more accurate and stable than the counterpart in various data distribution settings. The computational complexity is significantly reduced in our IPICE, especially when a new party joins the federation. IPICE assigns small contributions to bad/garbage data and thus prevent them from participating and deteriorating the learning ecosystem.",

        "Title": "Machine Learning in Mobile Crowd Sourcing: A Behavior-Based Recruitment Model",
        "Abstract": "With the advent of mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) systems and its applications, the selection of the right crowd is gaining utmost importance. The increasing variability in the context of MCS tasks makes the selection of not only the capable but also the willing workers crucial for a high task completion rate. Most of the existing MCS selection frameworks rely primarily on reputation-based feedback mechanisms to assess the level of commitment of potential workers. Such frameworks select workers having high reputation scores but without any contextual awareness of the workers, at the time of selection, or the task. This may lead to an unfair selection of workers who will not perform the task. Hence, reputation on its own only gives an approximation of workers\u2019 behaviors since it assumes that workers always behave consistently regardless of the situational context. However, following the concept of cross-situational consistency, where people tend to show similar behavior in similar situations and behave differently in disparate ones, this work proposes a novel recruitment system in MCS based on behavioral profiling. The proposed approach uses machine learning to predict the probability of the workers performing a given task, based on their learned behavioral models. Subsequently, a group-based selection mechanism, based on the genetic algorithm, uses these behavioral models in complementation with a reputation-based model to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the quality of recruitment of the tasks. Simulations based on a real-life dataset show that considering human behavior in varying situations improves the quality of recruitment achieved by the tasks and their completion confidence when compared with a benchmark that relies solely on reputation.",

        "Abstract": "The proliferation of innovative mobile services such as augmented reality, networked gaming, and autonomous driving has spurred a growing need for low-latency access to computing resources that cannot be met solely by existing centralized cloud systems. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network edge, in proximity to the end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be pre-stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in dense MEC networks with multidimensional constraints. We show that this problem generalizes several well-known placement and routing problems and propose an algorithm that achieves close-to-optimal performance using a randomized rounding technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize available storage, computation, and communication resources to maximize the number of requests served by low-latency edge cloud servers.",

        "Abstract": "Fog computing is a paradigm that brings computational resources and services to the network edge in the vicinity of user devices, lowering latency and connecting with cloud computing resources. Unlike cloud computing, fog resources are based on constrained and heterogeneous nodes whose connectivity can be unstable. In this complex scenario, there is a need to define and implement orchestration processes to ensure that applications and services can be provided, considering the settled agreements. Although some publications have dealt with orchestration in fog computing, there are still some diverse definitions and functional intersection with other areas, such as resource management and monitoring. This article presents a systematic review of the literature with focus on orchestration in fog computing. A generic architecture of fog orchestration is presented, created from the consolidation of the analyzed proposals, bringing to light the essential functionalities addressed in the literature. This work also highlights the main challenges and open research questions.",

        "Title": "Distributed Broadcasting in Dynamic Networks",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate distributed broadcasting in dynamic networks, where the topology changes continually over time. We propose a network model that captures the dynamicity caused by both churn and mobility of nodes. In contrast to existing work on dynamic networks, our model defines the dynamicity in terms of localized topological changes in the vicinity of each node, rather than a global view of the whole network. Obviously, a local dynamic model suits distributed algorithms better than a global one. The proposed dynamic model uses the more realistic SINR model to depict wireless interference, instead of oversimplified graph-based models adopted in most existing work. We consider the fundamental communication primitive of global broadcast, which is to disseminate a message from a source node to the whole network. Specifically, we present a randomized distributed algorithm that can accomplish dynamic broadcasting in an asymptotically optimal running time of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(D_{T})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> with a high probability guarantee, under the assumption of reasonably constant <italic>dynamicity rate</italic>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$D_{T}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the <italic>dynamic diameter</italic>, a parameter proposed to depict the complexity of dynamic broadcasting. We believe our local dynamic model can greatly facilitate distributed algorithm studies in mobile and dynamic wireless networks.",

        "Abstract": "Collusion attacks are considered to be challenging attacks in audio copyright protection. The traditional watermarking algorithms cannot identify the traitors when other attacks, such as desynchronization attacks, are applied with a collusion attack. Instead of tracing the traitors, in this paper we aim to tackle collusion attacks by removing the commercial value from the colluded copy, which will demotivate the attackers from launching collusion attacks. Since the commercial value of an audio signal is directly reflected by its perceptual quality, we propose a novel non-linear-echo generation (NLEG) based algorithm to significantly degrade the perceptual quality of the colluded copy by embedding a time delay sequence into the host signal. The proposed NLEG is also designed to be resilient to common signal processing attacks and desynchronization attacks. Furthermore, the proposed NLEG can be combined with other digital watermarking techniques to enhance its performance on protecting the copyright information. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed NLEG.",

        "Abstract": "Content replication and name-based routing lead to a natural multi-source and multipath transmission paradigm in NDN. Due to the unique connectionless characteristic of NDN, current end-to-end multipath congestion control schemes (e.g. MPTCP) cannot be used directly on NDN. This paper proposes a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) model to formulate multi-source and multipath transmission in NDN with in-network caches. From this model, a family of receiver-driven transmission solutions can be derived, named as path-specified congestion control. The path-specified congestion control enables content consumers to separate the traffic control on each path, which consequently facilitates fair and efficient bandwidth sharing amongst all consumers. As a specific instance, a Delay-based Path-specified Congestion Control Protocol (DPCCP) is presented, which utilizes queuing delays as signals to measure and control congestion levels of different bottlenecks. In addition, a set of high-performance congestion control laws are designed to accelerate bandwidth and fairness convergence towards the optimum defined by the NUM model. Finally, DPCCP is compared with state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental evaluations show that DPCCP outperforms existing solutions in terms of bandwidth utilization, convergence time and packet loss.",

        "Title": "Five Facets of 6G: Research Challenges and Opportunities",
        "Abstract": "Whilst the fifth-generation (5G) systems are being rolled out across the globe, researchers have turned their attention to the exploration of radical next-generation solutions. At this early evolutionary stage we survey five main research facets of this field, namely Facet 1: next-generation architectures, spectrum and services, Facet 2: next-generation networking, Facet 3: Internet of Things (IoT), Facet 4: wireless positioning and sensing, as well as Facet 5: applications of deep learning in 6G networks. In this paper, we have provided a critical appraisal of the literature of promising techniques ranging from the associated architectures, networking, applications as well as designs. We have portrayed a plethora of heterogeneous architectures relying on cooperative hybrid networks supported by diverse access and transmission mechanisms. The vulnerabilities of these techniques are also addressed and carefully considered for highlighting the most of promising future research directions. Additionally, we have listed a rich suite of learning-driven optimization techniques. We conclude by observing the evolutionary paradigm-shift that has taken place from pure single-component bandwidth-efficiency, power-efficiency or delay-optimization towards multi-component designs, as exemplified by the twin-component ultra-reliable low-latency mode of the 5G system. We advocate a further evolutionary step towards multi-component Pareto optimization, which requires the exploration of the entire Pareto front of all optiomal solutions, where none of the components of the objective function may be improved without degrading at least one of the other components.",

        "Title": "A Survey of Practical Formal Methods for Security",
        "Abstract": "In today\u2019s world, critical infrastructure is often controlled by computing systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking, and lightweight FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed, compared, and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers, commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety-critical systems, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends, and directions of research within this field.",

        "Abstract": "Data-driven machine learning (ML) has witnessed great success across a variety of application domains. Since ML model training relies on a large amount of data, there is a growing demand for high-quality data to be collected for ML model training. Data markets can be employed to significantly facilitate data collection. In this work, we demonstrate Dealer, an en<u>D</u>-to-end mod<u>e</u>l m<u>a</u>rketp<u>l</u>ace with diff<u>e</u>rential p<u>r</u>ivacy. Dealer consists of three entities, data owners, the broker, and model buyers. Data owners receive compensation for their data usages allocated by the broker; The broker collects data from data owners, builds and sells models to model buyers; Model buyers buy their target models from the broker. We demonstrate the functionalities of the three participating entities and the abbreviated interactions between them. The demonstration allows the audience to understand and experience interactively the process of model trading. The audience can act as a data owner to control what and how the data would be compensated, can act as a broker to price machine learning models with maximum revenue, as well as can act as a model buyer to purchase target models that meet expectations.",

        "Title": "Machine Learning at the Network Edge: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However, deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge of the network, i.e., close to the IoT devices where the data is generated. Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources. This survey describes major research efforts where machine learning systems have been deployed at the edge of computer networks, focusing on the operational aspects including compression techniques, tools, frameworks, and hardware used in successful applications of intelligent edge systems.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of vehicles (IoVs) is a variant of vehicular ad hoc network, which provides an efficient communication method for vehicles. However, some traffic messages usually include sensitive identity information, which is easy to bring about the leakage of vehicular identities during data communications. Further, if vehicular identities are fully protected, then it can lead to trusted authority cannot reveal the real identities of malicious vehicles, which incurs more security issues in IoVs. Therefore, in this article, we propose an efficient conditional identity privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on cooperation of multiple fog servers under fog computing-based IoVs, where fog servers are used to verify (authenticate) the legitimacy of vehicles without revealing their real identities. Further, an associated vehicular identity updating mechanism is constructed to solve the problem that some compromised fog servers may leak their stored verification information to pool real vehicular identities. Additionally, a malicious vehicular identity tracing mechanism is proposed to support related fog servers that receive signed false messages can trace the real identities of malicious vehicles. Compared with other related schemes, our scheme further improves its security. Experimental results show our scheme is efficient under fog computing-based IoVs.",

        "Abstract": "The growth of IoT technology, increasing prevalence of embedded devices, and advancements in biomedical technology have led to the emergence of numerous wearable health monitoring devices (WHMDs) in clinical settings and in the community. The majority of these devices are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled. Though the advantages offered by BLE-enabled WHMDs in tracking, diagnosing, and intervening with patients are substantial, the risk of cyberattacks on these devices is likely to increase with device complexity and new communication protocols. Furthermore, vendors face risk and financial tradeoffs between speed to market and ensuring device security in all situations. Previous research has explored the security and privacy of such devices by manually testing popular BLE-enabled WHMDs in the market and generally discussed categories of possible attacks, while mostly focused on IP devices. In this work, we propose a new semi-automated framework that can be used to identify and discover both known and unknown vulnerabilities in WHMDs. To demonstrate its implementation, we validate it with a number of commercially available BLE-enabled enabled wearable devices. Our results show that the devices are vulnerable to a number of attacks, including eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The proposed framework could therefore be used to evaluate potential devices before adoption into a secure network or, ideally, during the design and implementation of new devices.",

        "Abstract": "The increasing concerns on data security limit the sharing of data distributedly stored at multiple data owners and impede the scale of spatial queries over big urban data. In response, data federation systems have emerged to perform secure queries across multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation. However, existing systems are designed for relational data. They are highly inefficient on spatial queries and limited in usability. In this demonstration, we introduce Hu-Fu, the first data federation system for secure spatial queries with high efficiency and usability. Hu-Fu is designed from the perspectives of the query user and the data owner for high usability and decomposes a spatial query into as many plaintext operators and as few secure operators as possible for high efficiency. We demonstrate the deployment and usage of Hu-Fu via cross-company taxi-calling, a popular smart city application.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that incorporates a diverse range of things such as sensors, actuators, and services deployed by different organizations and individuals to support a variety of applications. The information captured by IoT present an unprecedented opportunity to solve large-scale problems in those application domains to deliver services; example applications include precision agriculture, environment monitoring, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart cities. Like all other Internet based services in the past, IoT-based services are also being developed and deployed without security consideration. By nature, IoT devices and services are vulnerable to malicious cyber threats as they cannot be given the same protection that is received by enterprise services within an enterprise perimeter. While IoT services will play an important role in our daily life resulting in improved productivity and quality of life, the trend has also \u201cencouraged\u201d cyber-exploitation and evolution and diversification of malicious cyber threats. Hence, there is a need for coordinated efforts from the research community to address resulting concerns, such as those presented in this special section. Several potential research topics are also identified in this special section.",

        "Title": "Privacy Intelligence: A Survey on Image Privacy in Online Social Networks",
        "Abstract": "Image sharing on online social networks (OSNs) has become an indispensable part of daily social activities, but it has also increased the risk of privacy invasion. An online image can reveal various types of sensitive information, prompting the public to rethink individual privacy needs in OSN image sharing critically. However, the interaction of images and OSN makes the privacy issues significantly complicated. The current real-world solutions for privacy management fail to provide adequate personalized, accurate, and flexible privacy protection. Constructing a more intelligent environment for privacy-friendly OSN image sharing is urgent in the near future. Meanwhile, given the dynamics in both users\u2019 privacy needs and OSN context, a comprehensive understanding of OSN image privacy throughout the entire sharing process is preferable to any views from a single side, dimension, or level. To fill this gap, we contribute a survey of \u201cprivacy intelligence\u201d that targets modern privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective. Specifically, we present the important properties and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, along with a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN image sharing and their associated privacy issues. Then a systematic review of representative intelligent solutions to those privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The analysis results in an intelligent \u201cprivacy firewall\u201d for closed-loop privacy management. Challenges and future directions in this area are also discussed.",

        "Title": "Energy-Efficient Database Systems: A Systematic Survey",
        "Abstract": "Constructing energy-efficient database systems to reduce economic costs and environmental impact has been studied for 10 years. With the emergence of the big data age, along with the data-centric and data-intensive computing trend, the great amount of energy consumed by database systems has become a major concern in a society that pursues Green IT. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this matter in Green IT, there have been few comprehensive or systematic studies conducted in this field. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a literature survey with breadth and depth on existing energy management techniques for database systems. The existing literature is organized hierarchically with two major branches focusing separately on energy consumption models and energy-saving techniques. Under each branch, we first introduce some basic knowledge, then we classify, discuss, and compare existing research according to their core ideas, basic approaches, and main characteristics. Finally, based on these observations through our study, we identify multiple open issues and challenges, and provide insights for future research. It is our hope that our outcome of this work will help researchers develop more energy-efficient database systems.",

        "Abstract": "The prosperity of machine learning has been accompanied by increasing attacks on the training process. Among them, poisoning attacks have become an emerging threat during model training. Poisoning attacks have profound impacts on the target models, e.g., making them unable to converge or manipulating their prediction results. Moreover, the rapid development of recent distributed learning frameworks, especially federated learning, has further stimulated the development of poisoning attacks. Defending against poisoning attacks is challenging and urgent. However, the systematic review from a unified perspective remains blank. This survey provides an in-depth and up-to-date overview of poisoning attacks and corresponding countermeasures in both centralized and federated learning. We firstly categorize attack methods based on their goals. Secondly, we offer detailed analysis of the differences and connections among the attack techniques. Furthermore, we present countermeasures in different learning framework and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the feasibility of poisoning attacks and address the potential research directions from attacks and defenses perspectives, separately.",

DIRECTGO collects various deterministic derivative-free DIRECT-type algorithms for box-constrained, generally constrained, and problems with hidden constraints. Each sequential algorithm is implemented in two ways: using static and dynamic data structures for more efficient information storage and organization. Furthermore, parallel schemes are applied to some promising algorithms within DIRECTGO. The toolbox is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring the user-friendly use of all functionalities available in DIRECTGO. Available features are demonstrated in detailed computational studies using a comprehensive DIRECTGOLib v1.0 library of global optimization test problems. Additionally, 11 classical engineering design problems illustrate the potential of DIRECTGO to solve challenging real-world problems. Finally, the appendix gives examples of accompanying MATLAB programs and provides a synopsis of its use on the test problems with box and general constraints.",

With the increasing demand of society and the continuous progress of technologies, UAV communication networks (UAVCN) are also flourishing. The mobility of UAV nodes allows for flexible network deployment, but some challenges are brought, such as power constraints, throughput, cost, and time efficiency. Therefore, path planning is significant for UAVCN. This paper presents a review of UAVCN path planning. We first introduce the network structure and performance evaluation of UAVCN. We then investigate the generic UAV path planning algorithms and the path planning algorithms in UAVCN. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of each path planning algorithm and the functional problems. The challenges faced in path planning for UAVCN, the solutions, state-of-the-art, and representative results are also presented. In addition, we illustrate future research directions for UAVCN path planning as well, which can provide some help to researchers.",

        "Title": "IoTRepair: Flexible Fault Handling in Diverse IoT Deployments",
        "Abstract": "IoT devices can be used to complete a wide array of physical tasks, but due to factors such as low computational resources and distributed physical deployment, they are susceptible to a wide array of faulty behaviors. Many devices deployed in homes, vehicles, industrial sites, and hospitals carry a great risk of damage to property, harm to a person, or breach of security if they behave faultily. We propose a general fault handling system named IoTRepair, which shows promising results for effectiveness with limited latency and power overhead in an IoT environment. IoTRepair dynamically organizes and customizes fault-handling techniques to address the unique problems associated with heterogeneous IoT deployments. We evaluate IoTRepair by creating a physical implementation mirroring a typical home environment to motivate the effectiveness of this system. Our evaluation showed that each of our fault-handling functions could be completed within 100 milliseconds after fault identification, which is a fraction of the time that state-of-the-art fault-identification methods take (measured in minutes). The power overhead is equally small, with the computation and device action consuming less than 30 milliwatts. This evaluation shows that IoTRepair not only can be deployed in a physical system, but offers significant benefits at a low overhead.",

        "Title": "Federated Learning in a Medical Context: A Systematic Literature Review",
        "Abstract": "Data privacy is a very important issue. Especially in fields like medicine, it is paramount to abide by the existing privacy regulations to preserve patients\u2019 anonymity. However, data is required for research and training machine learning models that could help gain insight into complex correlations or personalised treatments that may otherwise stay undiscovered. Those models generally scale with the amount of data available, but the current situation often prohibits building large databases across sites. So it would be beneficial to be able to combine similar or related data from different sites all over the world while still preserving data privacy. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution for this, because it relies on the sharing of machine learning models, instead of the raw data itself. That means private data never leaves the site or device it was collected on. Federated learning is an emerging research area, and many domains have been identified for the application of those methods. This systematic literature review provides an extensive look at the concept of and research into federated learning and its applicability for confidential healthcare datasets.",

        "Abstract": "The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid development and integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. The market is providing various consumer-oriented smart IoT devices; the mainstream cloud service providers are building their software stacks to support IoT services. With this emerging trend even growing, the security of such smart IoT cloud systems has drawn much research attention in recent years. To better understand the emerging consumer-oriented smart IoT cloud systems for practical engineers and new researchers, this article presents a review of the most recent research efforts on existing, real, already deployed consumer-oriented IoT cloud applications in the past five years using typical case studies. Specifically, we first present a general model for the IoT cloud ecosystem. Then, using the model, we review and summarize recent, representative research works on emerging smart IoT cloud system security using 10 detailed case studies, with the aim that the case studies together provide insights into the insecurity of current emerging IoT cloud systems. We further present a systematic approach to conduct a security analysis for IoT cloud systems. Based on the proposed security analysis approach, we review and suggest potential security risk mitigation methods to protect IoT cloud systems. We also discuss future research challenges for the IoT cloud security area.",

Due in part to the dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous architecture of the IoT, the varying and often low quality of spatial IoT data (SID) presents challenges to applications built on top of this data. This survey aims to provide unique insight to practitioners who intend to develop IoT-enabled applications and to researchers who wish to conduct research that relates to data quality in the IoT setting. The survey offers an inventory analysis of major data quality dimensions in SID and covers significant data characteristics and associated quality considerations. The survey summarizes data quality related technologies from both task and technique perspectives. Organizing the technologies from the task perspective, it covers recent progress in SID quality management, encompassing location refinement, uncertainty elimination, outlier removal, fault correction, data integration, and data reduction; and it covers low-quality SID exploitation, encompassing querying, analysis, and decision-making techniques. Finally, the survey covers emerging trends and open issues concerning the quality of SID.",

        "Title": "A Survey on Ransomware: Evolution, Taxonomy, and Defense Solutions",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end-users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial losses of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, and is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.",

        "Title": "Edge Computing in the Dark: Leveraging Contextual-Combinatorial Bandit and Coded Computing",
        "Abstract": "With recent advancements in edge computing capabilities, there has been a significant increase in utilizing the edge cloud for event-driven and time-sensitive computations. However, large-scale edge computing networks can suffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources which can result in high variability of service quality. We consider the problem of computation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of timely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we assume that each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions which are processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user after the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service quality of each edge device as function of context. The user decides the computations to offload to each device with the goal of receiving a recoverable set of computation results in the given deadline. By leveraging the <italic>coded computing</italic> framework in order to tackle failures or stragglers in computation, we formulate this problem using contextual-combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CC-MAB), and aim to maximize the cumulative expected reward. We propose an online learning policy called <italic>online coded edge computing policy</italic>, which provably achieves asymptotically-optimal performance in terms of regret loss compared with the optimal offline policy for the proposed CC-MAB problem. In terms of the cumulative reward, it is shown that the online coded edge computing policy significantly outperforms other benchmarks via numerical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have recently made outstanding contributions to the performance of information system and cyber--physical system security. There has been a plethora of research in this area, resulting in an outburst of publications over the past two years. Choosing the right algorithm to solve a complex security problem in a very precise industrial context is a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Learning Algorithm Recommendation Framework that, for a clearly defined situation, guides the selection of learning algorithm and scientific discipline (e.g. RNN, GAN, RL, CNN,...) which have sparked great interest to the scientific community and which therefore offers preponderant elements and benefits for further deployments. This framework has the advantage of having been generated from an extensive analysis of the literature, as illustrated by this paper for the recurrent neural networks and their variations.",

Although robust, BFT-SMR protocols are very costly in terms of the number of required replicas (3f+1 to tolerate f faults) and of exchanged messages. However, with \"hybrid\" architectures, where \"normal\" components trust some \"special\" components to provide properties in a trustworthy manner, the cost of using BFT can be dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, even though such hybridization techniques decrease the message/time/space complexity of BFT protocols, they also increase their structural complexity.",

        "Abstract": "In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China and has been reported in many countries with millions of people infected within only four months. Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Therefore, the proposed MADE-DBM model can be used in real-time COVID-19 classification systems.",

        "Abstract": "This investigation focuses on the application of computational intelligence to the security of Digital Twins (DTs) graphic data of the Cyber-physical System (CPS). The intricate and diverse physical space of CPS in the smart city is mapped in virtual space to construct the DTs CPS in the smart city. Besides, Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph-Big Multigraph (DPFS-BM) is employed to ensure data privacy security. Moreover, the analysis and prediction model for the DTs big graphic data (BGD) in the CPS is built based on Differential Privacy-AlexNet (DP-AlexNet). Alexnet successfully solves the gradient dispersion problem of the Sigmoid function of deep network structures. Finally, the comparative analysis approach is utilized to verify the performance of the model reported here by comparing it with Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, original AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron in a simulation experiment. Through the comparison in the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error, training time, and test time, the model proposed here outperforms other models regarding errors, time delay, and time consumption. In the same environment, the system performs better with multi-hop paths, extra relays, and a high fading index; in that case, the outage probability is minimal. Therefore, the DP-AlexNet model is suitable for processing BGD. Moreover, its speed acceleration is more apparent than that of other models, with a higher SpeedUp indicator. The research effectively combines data mining and data security, which is of significant value for optimizing the privacy protection technology of frequent subgraph mining on a single multi-graph. Besides, the constructed DTs of CPS can provide excellent accuracy and a prominent acceleration effect on the premise of low errors. In addition, the model reported here can provide reference for the intelligent and digital development of smart cities.",

        "Abstract": "Diversity is a great challenge for software engineers in the social sector context. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the identification of the RE processes and associated challenges in releasing the software in the social sector markets for which an exploratory case study is conducted. The outcome of the case study indicates that the diversity limits the ability to involve the representative samples of user populations using the same set of RE tools and techniques as one size fits all solution for all segments. The diverse user base must be partitioned into different segments, with each segment triggered using a suitable set of RE techniques i.e., traditional and crowd-based RE. The diverse perspectives learned as a result of the interaction with each segment, must be merged together into a single perspective about the software meant to be used in the social sector. There is a need for a new RE process specially designed for handling the complexities of the social sector, which this paper terms as Social Sector Requirement Engineering (SSRE). There is an increased need for collaboration between government social sector institutions and software engineers to get access to diverse customers to improve software quality.",

        "Abstract": "Today, users of social platforms upload a large number of photos. These photos contain personal private information, including user identity information, which is easily gleaned by intelligent detection algorithms. To thwart this, in this work, we propose an intelligent algorithm to prevent deep neural network (DNN) detectors from detecting private information, especially human faces, while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of the image. More specifically, we design an image privacy protection algorithm by training and generating a corresponding adversarial sample for each image to defend DNN detectors. In addition, we propose an improved model based on the previous model by training an adversarial perturbation generative network to generate perturbation instead of training for each image. We evaluate and compare our proposed algorithm with other methods on wider face dataset and others by three indicators: Mean average precision, Averaged distortion, and Time spent. The results show that our method significantly interferes with DNN detectors while causing weak impact to the visual quality of images, and our improved model does speed up the generation of adversarial perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid advancement of video and image processing technologies in the Internet of Things, it is urgent to address the issues in real-time performance, clarity, and reliability of image recognition technology for a monitoring system in foggy weather conditions. In this work, a fast defogging image recognition algorithm is proposed based on bilateral hybrid filtering. First, the mathematical model based on bilateral hybrid filtering is established. The dark channel is used for filtering and denoising the defogging image. Next, a bilateral hybrid filtering method is proposed by using a combination of guided filtering and median filtering, as it can effectively improve the robustness and transmittance of defogging images. On this basis, the proposed algorithm dramatically decreases the computation complexity of defogging image recognition and reduces the image execution time. Experimental results show that the defogging effect and speed are promising, with the image recognition rate reaching to 98.8% after defogging.",

        "Abstract": "Block chain provides an innovative solution to information storage, transaction execution, security, and trust building in an open environment. The block chain is technological progress for cyber security and cryptography, with efficiency-related cases varying in smart grids, smart contracts, over the IoT, etc. The movement to exchange data on a server has massively increased with the introduction of the Internet of Things. Hence, in this research, Splitting of proxy re-encryption method (Split-PRE) has been suggested based on the IoT to improve security and privacy in a private block chain. This study proposes a block chain-based proxy re-encryption program to resolve both the trust and scalability problems and to simplify the transactions. After encryption, the system saves the Internet of Things data in a distributed cloud. The framework offers dynamic, smart contracts between the sensor and the device user without the intervention of a trustworthy third party to exchange the captured IoT data. It uses an efficient proxy re-encryption system, which provides the owner and the person existing in the smart contract to see the data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed approach enhances the efficiency, security, privacy, and feasibility of the system when compared to other existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) now is one of the most important approach to instantiate asymmetric encryption and signature schemes, which has been extensively exploited to protect the security of cyber-physical systems. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a great deal of constrained devices may require software implementations of ECC operations. Under this circumstances, the SM2, a set of public key cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curves published by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office, was standardized at ISO in 2017 to enhance the cyber-security. However, few research works on the implementation of SM2 for constrained devices have been conducted. In this work, we fill this gap and propose our efficient, secure, and compact implementation of scalar multiplication on a 256-bit elliptic curve recommended by the SM2, as well as a comparison implementation of scalar multiplication on the same bit-length elliptic curve recommended by NIST. We re-design some existent techniques to fit the low-end IoT platform, namely 8-bit AVR processors, and our implementations evaluated on the desired platform show that the SM2 algorithms have competitive efficiency and security with NIST, which would work well to secure the IoT world.",

        "Abstract": "Fake news detection recently received a lot of attention from the scientific community and demands an optimal solution with high efficiency. Several studies were conducted using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to address the fake news identification problem. These studies, on the other hand, have some limitations like inefficient model design, improper pre-processing, and poor accuracy. Some factors contributing to poor accuracy include irrelevant features, improper model parameters, imbalanced datasets, and so on. This work proposes an optimized deep learning model for detecting fake news. The developed model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify fake and real news and utilizes hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search and random search to customize the hyperparameters of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimized LSTM model yields 99.65% accuracy using the ISOT dataset and 45.23% accuracy using the LIAR dataset.",

        "Abstract": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) suffers secure challenges, especially the eavesdropping attack, due to constraint resources. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and mobile edge computing (MEC) technology are adopted to formulate a DRL-MEC-based jamming-aided anti-eavesdropping (DMEC-JAE) scheme to resist the eavesdropping attack without considering the channel state information. In this scheme, a MEC sensor is chosen to send artificial jamming signals to improve the secrecy rate of the system. Power control technique is utilized to optimize the transmission power of both the source sensor and the MEC sensor to save energy. The remaining energy of the MEC sensor is concerned to ensure routine data transmission and jamming signal transmission. Additionally, the DMEC-JAE scheme integrates with transfer learning for a higher learning rate. The performance bounds of the scheme concerning the secrecy rate, energy consumption, and the utility are evaluated. Simulation results show that the DMEC-JAE scheme can approach the performance bounds with high learning speed, which outperforms the benchmark schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Federated Edge Learning (FEL) allows edge nodes to train a global deep learning model collaboratively for edge computing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which significantly promotes the development of Industrial 4.0. However, FEL faces two critical challenges: communication overhead and data privacy. FEL suffers from expensive communication overhead when training large-scale multi-node models. Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping attacks. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only improve communication efficiency but also mitigate malicious attacks while its accuracy is comparable to traditional FEL frameworks.",

In the Magic and EIA datasets, the algorithm constructed was compared with K-A and the L-diversity model to verify the performance of the model. The model constructed based on DP had the lowest privacy-leakage risks, which increased with the number of identifiers in the Magic and EIA datasets, and the information disclosure was the least. In addition, in its usability analysis, it was found that its value was the most obviously improved and its operation efficiency was the highest. The K-A-DP algorithm can effectively reduce the risk of privacy leakage and information loss, and has achieved excellent results. Despite the deficiencies in the process of the experiment, the study still provides a reference for solving the problem of medical data security.",

        "Abstract": "Access to resources by users may need to be granted only upon certain conditions and contexts, perhaps particularly in cyber-physical settings. Unfortunately, creating and modifying context-sensitive access control solutions in dynamic environments creates ongoing challenges to manage the authorization contexts. This article proposes RASA, a context-sensitive access authorization approach and mechanism leveraging unsupervised machine learning to automatically infer risk-based authorization decision boundaries. We explore RASA in a healthcare usage environment, wherein cyber and physical conditions create context-specific risks for protecting private health information. The risk levels are associated with access control decisions recommended by a security policy. A coupling method is introduced to track coexistence of the objects within context using frequency and duration of coexistence, and these are clustered to reveal sets of actions with common risk levels; these are used to create authorization decision boundaries. In addition, we propose a method for assessing the risk level and labelling the clusters with respect to their corresponding risk levels. We evaluate the promise of RASA-generated policies against a heuristic rule-based policy. By employing three different coupling features (frequency-based, duration-based, and combined features), the decisions of the unsupervised method and that of the policy are more than 99% consistent.",

        "Title": "Addressing Waste Separation With a Persuasive Augmented Reality App",
        "Abstract": "Separating and recycling waste is an important topic to protect our environment and achieve a more sustainable future. However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.",

Hash-based Message Authentication Code is used to cancel the list-checking process and analyze its security performance. Compared with the methods of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, Bayes least-square method, identity-based bulk verification, anonymous batch authentication and key protocol, conditional privacy authentication scheme, and expert message authentication protocol, the transmission delay, packet loss rate, and computation cost are studied without considering the undo list and during the undo check. The results show that with the increase of information size, the transmission delay and packet loss rate also increase, and the transmission delay of ABAH increases by about 15%, while the correlation between speed and transmission delay is small. In the case of the same amount of validation information, ABAH has the highest validation efficiency, and it still has an efficient validation effect in the case of invalid information. The message packet loss rate for ABAH is always 0 when the undo check validation overhead is considered. It can be found that ABAH can avoid the communication overhead and privacy leakage caused by the revocation list, ensure the integrity of batch verification information, meet the security performance of the vehicular ad hoc network under the Internet of Things, and protect the privacy of users from being disclosed.",

For the Internet of Things (IoT), LoRaWAN is one of the dominant technologies for urban environments, industrial settings, or critical infrastructures due to its low-power and long-range capabilities. LoRaWAN IoT deployments are expected to operate for multiple years or even decades. Hence, it is imperative to maintain operational security at all times while continuously evolving the security of the standard and its implementations. We survey LoRaWAN security and follow a systematic and evolvable approach that can be dynamically updated. To this end, we propose a novel methodology to create evolvable surveys which relate the analyzed critical security concepts, thus allowing IT security experts to reason about LoRaWAN security properties over time. With this, we provide a tool to hardware manufacturers, software developers and providers, and network operators to achieve sustainable security for IoT deployments.",

        "Title": "Roadside Unit-Based Unknown Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions for Smart Internet of Vehicles",
        "Abstract": "For Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, reliable autonomous driving systems usually perform the majority of their computations on the cloud due to the limited computing power of edge devices. The communication delay between cloud platforms and edge devices, however, can cause dangerous consequences, particularly for latency-sensitive object detection tasks. Object detection tasks are also vulnerable to significantly degraded model performance caused by unknown objects, which creates unsafe driving conditions. To address these problems, this study develops an orchestrated system that allows real-time object detection and incrementally learns unknown objects in a complex and dynamic environment. A YOLO-based object detection model in edge computing mode uses thermal images to detect objects accurately in poor lighting conditions. In addition, an attention mechanism improves the system\u2019s performance without significantly increasing model complexity. An unknown object detector (UOD) automatically classifies and labels unknown objects without direct supervision on edge devices, while a roadside unit (RSU)-based mechanism is developed to update classes and ensure a secure driving experience for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the interactions between edge devices, RSU servers, and the cloud are designed to allow efficient collaboration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system learns uncategorized objects dynamically and detects instances accurately.",

        "Abstract": "A better understanding of how advancement in science and technology affect students\u2019 learning behavior in academic setting can help all educators in higher education. With the advancement of science and technology, the new-generation information technology represented by \"Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of Things, Mobile Network and Artificial Intelligence\" has been profoundly changing the form of education, accelerating the transformation from Teaching 1.0 to Learning 2.0. To investigate the factors influencing university students using new generation of information technology in intelligent foreign language learning, this study proposed a research model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The sample data were collected from a survey of 237 students at a university. The analysis of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, construction of foreign language intelligence classroom, and computer self-efficacy all have a positive impact on learners\u2019 behavioral intention. These findings suggest that more emphasis should be laid on students\u2019 learning characteristics, advantages of new generation of technology, as well as teachers\u2019 intelligent literacy, so as to further promote the deep integration of the new-generation information technology and intelligent foreign language learning, improving the learning effectiveness ultimately and effectively.",

        "Abstract": "Pneumothorax is a common pulmonary disease that can lead to dyspnea and can be life-threatening. X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, an image classification algorithm based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for high-resolution medical image analysis of pneumothorax X-rays, which features a Network In Network (NIN) for cleaning the data, random histogram equalization data augmentation processing, and a DCNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively increase the correct diagnosis rate of pneumothorax, and the Area under Curve (AUC) of the test verified in the experiment is 0.9844 on ZJU-2 test data and 0.9906 on the ChestX-ray14, respectively. In addition, a large number of atmospheric pleura samples are visualized and analyzed based on the experimental results and in-depth learning characteristics of the algorithm. The analysis results verify the validity of feature extraction for the network. Combined with the results of these two aspects, the proposed X-ray image processing algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy of pneumothorax photographs.",

In this paper, a novel service paradigm combined with wireless communication in integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN) is proposed. On this basis, an affective services computing offloading and transmission network (ASCTN) with a three-tier computation architecture is proposed, which is able to assist users to obtain affective computing services and regulate emotions. The optimization problem is investigated in the ASCTN, which is a discrete, non-linear, and non-convex problem with the limitation of computation ability of satellite and transmit power. Specifically, with the objective to minimize the cost utility related to latency and energy consumption, a joint affective services tasks computing offloading strategy, sub-channel, and power allocation algorithm based on dueling deep Q-network (Dueling-DQN) is proposed, which is in possession of better stability. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm in terms of the cost utility in the ASCTN system.",

        "Abstract": "Governments and public sector organizations are digitalizing their service provisions to cut costs, improve public administration efficiency, provide better services to citizens and companies, or increase transparency of expenditure and decision-making. Often these attempts are local where each agency, city, municipality, or even a single department develops its own solutions. However, it is difficult to scale these up to broader contexts, e.g., governmental or regional level since they are designed for local needs. From this perspective, top-down initiatives, such as the use of common platforms, may result in more benefits. In this paper, we study a government-initiated platform for citizen-civil servant messaging in eight municipalities, each autonomously making decisions related to their service provision. The municipalities got a shared grant to co-tailor the platform to save resources and to learn together how to make best out of it and avoid possible problems. We study why this joint endeavor turned out to be difficult by utilizing the windows of opportunity theory as a research lens. We identify different challenges in service co-tailoring, including dissimilar practices, processes, skills and competencies, and attitudes and goals, and argue that co-tailoring and co-experimentation necessitates careful planning and consideration of these differences.",

He shares his concerns about the spread of disinformation and the way that the negative feedback loop created by rating systems encourage the propagation of sensationalism and falsehoods. He argues that, while authentication technology, in particular, will play an important role in fostering a more civil and civic Internet, ultimately, the solutions for strengthening democracy lie less with technology than in critical thinking by individuals and more democratically governed, bottom-up, and consensus-based institutions. Some of these institutions already exist while new ones have yet to be invented with robust new governance mechanisms to foster international collaboration on some of the hardest issues of our time.",

Researchers commonly use known promoter features in a variety of species to predict promoter motifs. However the results are not particularly useful. Different species rarely have similar features in promoter binding sites. In this study, we adopt sequence analysis techniques to find the possible promoter binding sites among different species. We sought to improve the existing algorithm to suit the task of mining sequential patterns with specific number of gaps. Moreover, we discuss the implementation of proposed method in a distributed environment. The proposed method finds the transcription start sites (TSS) and extracts possible promoter regions from DNA sequences according to TSS. We derived the motifs in the possible promoter regions, while taking into account the number of gaps in the motifs to deal with unimportant nucleotides. The motifs generated from promoter regions using the proposed methodology were shown to tolerate unimportant nucleotides. A comparison with known promoter motifs verified the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "As a critical branch of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the medicine industry, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) significantly improves the quality of healthcare due to its real-time monitoring and low medical cost. Benefiting from edge and cloud computing, IoMT is provided with more computing and storage resources near the terminal to meet the low-delay requirements of computation-intensive services. However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.",

One of the initial activities was relating to the opening of vast amounts of data from various public administrations and utility companies within a city in order to create a viable eco-system of urban services and applications. Thereby, the harvested metadata needed to be verified in terms of correctness and a corresponding level of quality had to be assured. In addition, the concept of an Open Urban Platform emerged as an overall solution for smart cities Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the sense that an abstract reference model was established and standardized, providing an overall picture of the ICT structures within a city. Within this article, we use the Open Urban Platform concept as the basics to describe and map our activities within the Open Data domain, focusing mainly on the Open Data prototype for German Open Governmental Data\u2014namely GovData.DE. Thereby, we describe our metadata harvesting and metadata quality assurance approach and discuss on lessons learned, which flow into the definition of metadata quality metrics and have the potential to lead to a corresponding standard within the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung e.V.

        "Title": "Digital Trust and the Reconstruction of Trust in the Digital Society: An Integrated Model based on Trust Theory and Expectation Confirmation Theory",
        "Abstract": "Digital trust is born with the evolution of digital society. It is an inescapable topic in the digital society and it is developed from traditional interpersonal trust and institutional trust and has been extensively used in the Internet space. At present, the research on digital trust is rare. Based on the Trust Theory and the Expectation Confirmation Theory, this paper puts forward an integration model with user satisfaction as the intermediary variable. Besides, this paper develops a set of scales for evaluating digital trust combined with maturity scales and points out that digital trust consists of digital cognitive trust and emotional trust. This paper assumed that user perception and user expectation indirectly affect digital trust through user satisfaction and used SPSS 23.0 to do reliability, validity test, and exploratory factor analysis. The results found that user satisfaction plays a mediating role by fitting, evaluating, and optimizing the structural equation model with AMOS23.0. User satisfaction is a partial intermediary between user perception and digital trust, and it is the complete intermediary between user expectation and digital trust. These results demonstrate two things. Firstly, in the digital society, the construction of users' digital trust is based on users' satisfaction. The government should provide diversified and high-quality e-government services as far as possible. Secondly, digital trust is directly or indirectly affected by user perception and user expectation. The government should build a safe, green, and harmonious digital environment for users and make e-government services consistent with users' expectation.",

        "Abstract": "In this digital age, human dependency on technology in various fields has been increasing tremendously. Torrential amounts of different electronic products are being manufactured daily for everyday use. With this advancement in the world of Internet technology, cybersecurity of software and hardware systems are now prerequisites for major business\u2019 operations. Every technology on the market has multiple vulnerabilities that are exploited by hackers and cyber-criminals daily to manipulate data sometimes for malicious purposes. In any system, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a fundamental component for ensuring the security of devices from digital attacks. Recognition of new developing digital threats is getting harder for existing IDS. Furthermore, advanced frameworks are required for IDS to function both efficiently and effectively. The commonly observed cyber-attacks in the business domain include minor attacks used for stealing private data. This article presents a deep learning methodology for detecting cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things using a Long Short Term Networks classifier. Our extensive experimental testing show an Accuracy of 99.09%, F1-score of 99.46%, and Recall of 99.51%, respectively. A detailed metric representing our results in tabular form was used to compare how our model was better than other state-of-the-art models in detecting cyber-attacks with proficiency.",

        "Title": "Analysis of Trending Topics and Text-based Channels of Information Delivery in Cybersecurity",
        "Abstract": "Computer users are generally faced with difficulties in making correct security decisions. While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts from this grey literature can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by creating the patterns of the security knowledge gained from different sources. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Moreover, existing topic modelling methods are not capable of identifying the cybersecurity concepts completely and the generated topics considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories to analyse trending topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings as follows: (1) The impact reflected from cybersecurity texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes, (2) security blogs have produced the context of cybersecurity most intensively, and (3) websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much.",

Secure and reliable communication and efficient on-device performance are thus crucial challenges in this paradigm, particularly in presence of limited computation resources. This paper presents a novel secure and energy-efficient message communication system, called <italic>MComIoV</italic>, using a one-way hash function and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

        "Abstract": "Online social networks provide a convenient platform for the spread of rumors, which could lead to serious aftermaths such as economic losses and public panic. The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on a one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there is more than one feature associated with an object. A user's impression on this object is determined not just by one feature but by her overall evaluation of all features associated with it. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the spread of multiple features. Based on that, we design a multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper and formulate a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure according to this model. To solve the MFRB problem, we design a creative sampling method called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to this multi-layer network structure. Then, we propose a Revised-IMM algorithm and obtain a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our Revised-IMM and its advantage to their baseline algorithms.",

        "Title": "A Federated Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Smart Buildings",
        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in smart buildings are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable. These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising the prediction performance.",

At the same time, the pervasive internet connections of these systems necessitate the fundamental design of security into these devices. The isolation of complex features from those that are critical through protection domains is an effective means to constrain the scope of faults and security breaches. Common hardware-provided memory facilities to enforce protection domains through memory access control -- including Memory Management Units (MMUs) usually found in microprocessors, and Memory Protection Units (MPUs) usually found in microcontrollers -- must meet the goals of enabling flexible, efficient and dynamic management of memory, and must enable tight bounds on the worst-case execution of critical code. Unfortunately, current system memory management facilities are ill-prepared to handle this challenge: MMUs that use extensive caches to achieve strong average-case performance suffer from debilitating worst-case and even average-case behavior under hefty interference, while MPUs struggle to provide flexible memory management.",

For instance, commonly used policies that nominally &#x201C;boost&#x201D; the sharing of infrequent chunks such as the well-known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. We take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a policy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s), that we call mode-suppression. We also consider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode frequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. We prove the stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman bound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer arrival rate. We then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small number of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating these samples over time. We show numerically that mode suppression stabilizes and outperforms all other recently proposed chunk sharing algorithms, and via integration into BitTorrent implementation operating over the ns-3 that it ensures stable, low sojourn time operation in a real-world setting.",

        "Title": "From awareness to influence: toward a model for improving employees\u2019 security behaviour",
        "Abstract": "This paper argues that a conventional approach to cybersecurity awareness is not effective in influencing employees and creating sustainable behaviour change. The increase in security incidents caused by employees is evidence that providing information to raise employees\u2019 awareness does not necessarily result in improving their security behaviour, and organisations must transform their security awareness program to extend beyond awareness to influence and behaviour change. This paper presents an in-depth case study of Telstra a leading Australian telecommunication company with a well-resourced and mature cybersecurity influence program that evolved as a result of experience throughout the years. The paper adopts the psychological attachment theory to explain strategies (e.g. cybersecurity champion) implemented by Telstra influence team to influence employees to improve their security-related behaviour. The contribution of this paper represents the first step for a comprehensive practice-based guidance for organisations on how to transform their cybersecurity beyond awareness to influence behavioural change. This paper is based on both academic and industrial perspectives, and it provides a sound basis for future empirical work.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we argue that off-balance-sheet information is potentially useful to evaluate accounting information quality in addition to financial indicators. We propose a novel method to evaluate the accounting information quality of listed companies in China by merging four financial attributes and six indicators derived from off-balance-sheet information, where the principal component analysis is used to filter the indicators which count heavily for the evaluation. Validation and comparison are implemented on the dataset of all financial frauds and violations (5031 cases) of 1995 listed companies of Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2003 to 2017. The results show that the proposed method outperforms both the traditional \u201cDD model\u201d (Dechow and Dichev, The Accounting Review 77(1):35\u201359, 2002) and the model only involving financial indicators in identifying and predicting financial fraud of enterprises. The results highlight that off-balance-sheet information is indeed useful and important to evaluate accounting information quality.",

        "Abstract": "Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called <italic>FlyTera</italic>. In <italic>FlyTera</italic>, a set of hotspots mounted on flying drones collaboratively provide data streaming services to ground users, in the microwave, mmWave and THz bands. We first provide a mathematical formulation of the <italic>FlyTera</italic> control problem, where the objective is to maximize the network spectral efficiency by jointly controlling the flight of the drone hotspots, their association to the ground users, and the spectrum bands used by the users. To solve the resulting problem, which is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming (MINLP) problem, we design distributed solution algorithms based on a combination of echo state learning and reinforcement learning. An extensive simulation campaign is then conducted with SimBAG, a newly developed <underline>Sim</underline>ulator of <underline>B</underline>roadband <underline>A</underline>erial-<underline>G</underline>round wireless networks. It is shown that no single spectrum band can meet the requirements of high data rate and wide coverage simultaneously. Moreover, from the network-level point of view, THz-band communications can significantly benefit from the mobility of the flying drones, and on average <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4 - 6$ </tex-math></inline-formula> times <italic>higher (rather than lower)</italic> throughput can be achieved in mobile than in static environments.",

        "Title": "PFCA: A Programmable FIB Caching Architecture",
        "Abstract": "Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) chips are used to store Forwarding Information Bases (FIB) in modern routers. TCAM provides next-hop lookup for IP packets at the line-rate. However, TCAM is expensive and energy-consuming; in addition, the constant FIB growth may lead to TCAM overflow problem. Yet only a small portion of FIB entries carries the most of network traffic. Thus, FIB caching, namely, installing the most popular entries in a fast memory, e.g., TCAM, may significantly minimize TCAM usage. To date, FIB caching architecture has not been widely deployed in backbone routers due to high cache-miss latency and the lack of an efficient cache replacement strategy. In this work, we leverage the concept of the programmable data plane to design a Programmable FIB Caching Architecture (PFCA) with two levels of cache. We present a pipeline-based algorithm to detect the least popular prefixes in a cache for a victim selection. We tested the prototype of PFCA using real traffic traces and an FIB with more than 599K entries, and showed that PFCA can be implemented using P4 programmable data plane language. Our results show that PFCA achieves 99.8% hit ratio for Level-1 cache with 20K entries and nearly 99.9% hit ratio for Level-2 cache with 40K entries. We also demonstrate that PFCA significantly reduces the number of BGP updates in the cache and thus makes the cache more stable.",

More recently, crisis informatics has developed an analysis of these phenomena from social and computational perspectives. To further to assess the consequences and opportunities of technological developments in the field, we re-interpret the concept of informating, first developed by Zuboff to describe the impacts of technological changes on the workplace during the 1980s. We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.",

        "Abstract": "As the demand for taxi reservation services has increased, increasing the income of taxi drivers with advanced services has attracted attention. In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver's profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H* (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on guiding a route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers under the constraint of booking information.",

This work addresses defending against remote exploitation attacks on vulnerable IoT devices. As an attack mitigation strategy, we assume it is not possible to fix all the vulnerabilities and propose to diversify the open-source software used to manage IoT devices. Our approach is to deploy dynamic cloud-based virtual machine proxies for physical IoT devices. Our architecture leverages virtual machine proxies with diverse software configurations to mitigate vulnerable and static software configurations on physical devices. We develop an algorithm for selecting new configurations based on network anomaly detection signals to learn vulnerable software configurations on IoT devices, automatically shifting towards more secure configurations. Cloud-based proxy machines mediate requests between application clients and vulnerable IoT devices, facilitating a dynamic diversification system. We report on simulation experiments to evaluate the dynamic system. Two models of powerful adversaries are introduced and simulated against the diversified defense strategy. Our experiments show that a dynamically diversified IoT architecture can be invulnerable to large classes of attacks that would succeed against a static architecture.",

CTVM asks for the most cost-effective users to influence the most relevant users. In contrast to the vast literature, we attempt to offer exact solutions. As the problem is NP-hard, thus, exact solutions are intractable, we propose TipTop, a $1-\\epsilon$ -optimal solution for arbitrary $\\epsilon >0$ that scales to very large networks, such as Twitter. At the heart of TipTop lies an innovative technique that reduces the number of samples as much as possible. This allows us to exactly solve CTVM on a much smaller space of generated samples using integer programming. Furthermore, TipTop lends a tool for researchers to benchmark their solutions against the optimal one in large-scale networks, which is currently not available.",

        "Title": "Anomaly Detection and Attribution in Networks With Temporally Correlated Traffic",
        "Abstract": "Anomaly detection in communication networks is the first step in the challenging task of securing a network, as anomalies may indicate suspicious behaviors, attacks, network malfunctions, or failures. In this paper, we address the problem of not only detecting the anomalous events but also of attributing the anomaly to the flows causing it. To this end, we develop a new statistical decision theoretic framework for temporally correlated traffic in networks via Markov chain modeling. We first formulate the optimal anomaly detection problem via the generalized likelihood ratio test GLRT for our composite model. This results in a combinatorial optimization problem which is prohibitively expensive. We then develop two low-complexity anomaly detection algorithms. The first is based on the cross entropy CE method, which detects anomalies as well as attributes anomalies to flows. The second algorithm performs anomaly detection via GLRT on the aggregated flows transformation\u2014a compact low-dimensional representation of the raw traffic flows. The two algorithms complement each other and allow the network operator to first activate the flow aggregation algorithm in order to quickly detect anomalies in the system. Once an anomaly has been detected, the operator can further investigate which specific flows are anomalous by running the CE-based algorithm. We perform extensive performance evaluations and experiment our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, as well as on real Internet traffic data obtained from the MAWI archive, and finally make recommendations regarding their usability.",

        "Abstract": "Data sensing and gathering is an essential task for various information-driven services in smart cities. On the one hand, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can be deployed at certain fixed locations to capture data reliably but suffer from limited sensing coverage. On the other hand, data can also be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary users but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users\u2019 contributions. In this article, we explore an integrated paradigm called \u201chybrid sensing\u201d that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary manner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not covered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in calibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that can be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In this article, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user privacy\u2014IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private user data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a privacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of our system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available parking spaces in outdoor parking lots. We implemented our hybrid sensing system for smart parking and conducted extensive empirical evaluations. Finally, our hybrid sensing system can be potentially applied to other information-driven services in smart cities.",

        "Abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) have gained enormous popularity in recent years. They provide a dynamic platform for sharing content (text messages or multimedia) and for facilitating communication between friends and acquaintances. Microblogging services are a popular form of OSNs. They allow sending small messages in a one-to-many messaging model so that users can communicate with their favorite celebrity, brand, politician, or other regular users without the obligation of a pre-existing social relationship. A chain of privacy-related scandals linked to questionable data handling practices in microblogging services has arisen in the last past few years. Most current microblogging service providers offer centralized services and their business model is based on monitoring, analyzing, and selling users\u2019 activity and patterns. In the end, the personal information shared by the users to benefit from the free-of-charge services is used for the underlying payment in such systems. In this paper, we present Garlanet, a privacy-aware censorship-resistant microblogging social network that does not rely on a centralized service provider as all data is hosted in computers voluntarily contributed by the users of the system. Garlanet provides microblogging functionalities while protecting privacy and preserving the confidentiality and integrity of users and data. It ensures that users\u2019 identities and their social graphs are hidden from the system and adversaries and it provides availability and scalability of the services. We also evaluate the privacy level of Garlanet and we compare it with the privacy level of eight other microblogging systems.",

Unfortunately, only a few datasets are publicly available for research in health insurance domain, yet none reports any negative claims. However, negative claims are essential not only to develop new machine learning approaches but also to test and validate automated artificial intelligence systems deployed by insurance providers. In this study, we introduce a synthetic negative claim generation procedure based on the bipartite graph representations of positive claims. Our empirical results demonstrate promising outcomes that will improve the development and evaluation processes of machine learning approaches in healthcare, where negative samples are required, but not available. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be applied to other domains, where bipartite graph representations are meaningful and negative samples are lacking.",

Various emerging applications are promising to enrich users\u2019 traveling experiences and daily life. However, how to execute computing-intensive applications on resource-constrained vehicles still faces huge challenges. In this article, we construct an intelligent offloading system for vehicular edge computing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. First, both the communication and computation states are modelled by finite Markov chains. Moreover, the task scheduling and resource allocation strategy is formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize users\u2019 Quality of Experience (QoE). Due to its complexity, the original problem is further divided into two sub-optimization problems. A two-sided matching scheme and a deep reinforcement learning approach are developed to schedule offloading requests and allocate network resources, respectively.

        "Abstract": "With the increasing diffusion of Internet probing technologies, a large amount of regularly collected traceroutes are available for Internet service providers ISPs at low cost. We show how it is possible, given solely an arbitrary set of traceroutes, to spot routing paths that change similarly over time and aggregate them into inferred routing events. With respect to previous works, our approach does not require any knowledge of the network, does not need complex integration of several data sources, and exploits the asynchronicity of measurements to accurately position events in time. The formal model at the basis of our methodology revolves around the notion of empathy, a relation that binds similarly behaving traceroutes. The correctness and completeness of our approach are based on structural properties that are easily expressed in terms of empathic measurements. We perform experiments with data from public measurement infrastructures like RIPE Atlas, showing the effectiveness of our algorithm in distilling significant events from a large amount of traceroute data. We also validate the accuracy of the inferred events against ground-truth knowledge of routing changes originating from induced and spontaneous routing events. Given these promising results, we believe that our methodology can be an effective aid for troubleshooting at the ISPs level. The source code of our algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/empadig.",

        "Abstract": "With the proliferation of mobile devices and various sensors e.g., GPS, magnetometer, accelerometers, gyroscopes equipped, richer services, e.g. location based services, are provided to users. A series of methods have been proposed to protect the users\u2019 privacy, especially the trajectory privacy. Hardware fingerprinting has been demonstrated to be a surprising and effective source for identifying/authenticating devices. In this work, we show that a few data samples collected from the motion sensors are enough to uniquely identify the source mobile device, i.e., the raw motion sensor data serves as a fingerprint of the mobile device. Specifically, we first analytically understand the fingerprinting capacity using features extracted from hardware data. To capture the essential device feature automatically, we design a multi-LSTM neural network to fingerprint mobile device sensor in real-life uses, instead of using handcrafted features by existing work. Using data collected over 6 months, for arbitrary user movements, our fingerprinting model achieves 93% F-score given one second data, while the state-of-the-art work achieves 79% F-score. Given ten seconds randomly sampled data, our model can achieve 98.8% accuracy. We also propose a novel generative model to modify the original sensor data and yield anonymized data with little fingerprint information while retain good data utility.",

        "Abstract": "To tackle the contradiction between the computation intensive applications and the resource-hungry mobile user equipments UEs, mobile edge computing MEC has been provisioned as a promising solution, which enables the UEs to offload the tasks to the MEC servers. Considering the characteristics of small cell networks SCNs, integrating MEC into SCNs is natural. But in terms of the high interference, multi-access property, and limited resources of small cell base stations SBSs, an efficient computation offloading scheme is essential. However, there still lack comprehensive studies on this problem in the densely deployed SCNs. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient computation offloading management scheme in the MEC system with SCNs. The aim of this paper is to minimize the energy consumption of all UEs via jointly optimizing computation offloading decision making, spectrum, power, and computation resource allocation. Specially, the UEs need not only to decide whether to offload but also to determine where to offload. First, we present the computation offloading model and formulate this problem as a mix integer non-linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. Taking advantages of genetic algorithm GA and particle swarm optimization PSO, we design a suboptimal algorithm named as hierarchical GA and PSO-based computation algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, the convergence of this algorithm is studied by simulation, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with the other baseline algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Network K-function has been the de facto operation for analyzing point patterns in spatial networks, which is widely used in many communities, including geography, ecology, transportation science, social science, and criminology. To analyze a location dataset, domain experts need to generate a network K-function plot that involves computing multiple network K-functions. However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions. In addition, we incorporate the advanced shortest path sharing (ASPS) approach into these two methods to further lower the worst-case time complexity for generating network K-function plots. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets (up to 7.33 million data points) show that our methods can achieve up to 165.85x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Abstract": "Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. Based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default Dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",

        "Title": "Towards Personalized Privacy-Preserving Truth Discovery Over Crowdsourced Data Streams",
        "Abstract": "Truth discovery is an effective paradigm which could reveal the truth from crowdsouced data with conflicts, enabling data-driven decision-making systems to make quick and smart decisions. The increasing privacy concern promotes users to perturb or encrypt their private data before outsourcing, which poses significant challenges for truth discovery. Although several privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanisms have been proposed, none of them take personal privacy expectation into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel personalized privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPPTD) framework over crowdsourced data streams to achieve timely and accurate truth discovery while guaranteeing the protection of individual privacy. The key challenges of PPPTD lie in improving the accuracy of truth estimation from the perturbed streaming data with personalized protection level. To address these challenges, we first develop a personalized budget initialization mechanism to quantify each user&#x2019;s privacy protection requirement, and allocate personalized privacy budgets to users according to their privacy requirements. Then we propose a deviation-aware weighted aggregation method to improve the accuracy of truth discovery from streaming data with varying degrees of perturbation. In order to achieve privacy-utility tradeoff, we further propose an influence-aware adaptive budget adjustment mechanism that adaptively re-allocates privacy budgets to users based on the evolution of their influence in the weighted aggregation. We prove that PPPTD can achieve <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-differential privacy over the whole data generated by users and satisfy individual personalized privacy requirements. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PPPTD.",

        "Abstract": "As one of the essential applications of health information technology, the eHealth system plays a significant role in enabling various internet medicine service scenes, most of which primarily rely on service recommendation or an evaluation mechanism. To avoid privacy leakage, some privacy-preserving mechanisms must be adopted to protect raters\u2019 privacy and make evaluation trust reliable. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes an efficient service recommendation and evaluation scheme, called EPRT, which is based on a similarity calculation and trust discovery method. This scheme uses homomorphic encryption technology to encrypt the sensitive data and combines the threshold mechanism and double-trap mechanism to realize the secure computing on the encrypted data, so as to ensure that the plaintexts of the final calculation results (e.g., recommendation value and evaluation truth) are only obtained by the authorized subject. In addition, a detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EPRT scheme can achieve the expected security. In addition, performance comparison results are carried out, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of authenticating the transmitter device in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This problem is important because of high vulnerabilities in wireless communications and an additional security vulnerability when some users collude with the adversary. In this paper, we consider two attacking scenarios. In the first scenario, there is no user that colludes with the adversary. In the second scenario, at least one user colludes with the adversary. In this paper, we propose an authentication approach in the down-link scheme of a NOMA system using physical-layer authentication mechanism because of its advantages: provide information theoretic security, reduce complexity, save power and allow us to construct a two-factor authentication system. Based on the aforementioned two attacking scenarios, we propose three physical-layer authentication schemes for a NOMA system: Physical-Layer Authentication with Shared Authentication Tag (PLA-SAT), Physical-Layer Authentication with Superimposed Independent authentication Tags (PLA-SIT), and Physical-Layer Authentication with TDM authentication tags (PLA-TDM). We analyze the theoretical performance of our schemes over fading channels and derive their closed-form expressions. Then, we optimize the parameters of our schemes to achieve both the reliability fairness and the authentication-accuracy fairness. We implemented our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparisons. Our experimental results show that for the first attacking scenario, the PLA-SAT scheme offers more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 10 dB. For the second attacking scenario, both the PLA-SIT scheme and the PLA-TDM scheme offer more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 12 dB.",

However, health data sharing poses several security issues, such as access control and privacy leakage, as well as faces critical challenges to obtain efficient data analysis and services. In this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fog-assisted health data sharing (PFHDS) scheme for e-healthcare systems. Specifically, we integrate the fog node to classify the shared data into different categories according to disease risks for efficient health data analysis. Meanwhile, we design an enhanced attribute-based encryption method through combination of a personal access policy on patients and a professional access policy on the fog node for effective medical service provision. Furthermore, we achieve significant encryption consumption reduction for patients by offloading a portion of the computation and storage burden from patients to the fog node. Security discussions show that PFHDS realizes data confidentiality and fine-grained access control with collusion resistance. Performance evaluations demonstrate cost-efficient encryption computation, storage and energy consumption.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents Merlin, a framework for managing resources in software-defined networks. With Merlin, administrators express high-level policies using programs in a declarative language. The language includes logical predicates to identify sets of packets, regular expressions to encode forwarding paths, and arithmetic formulas to specify bandwidth constraints. The compiler maps these policies into a constraint problem that determines bandwidth allocations using parametrizable heuristics. It then generates a code that can be executed on the network elements to enforce the policies. To allow network tenants to dynamically adapt policies to their needs, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Experiments demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of Merlin on realistic scenarios. Overall, Merlin simplifies network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying and enforcing network policies.",

        "Title": "Spooky: granulating LSM-tree compactions correctly",
        "Abstract": "Modern storage engines and key-value stores have come to rely on the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) as their core data structure. LSM-tree operates by gradually merge-sorting data across levels of exponentially increasing capacities in storage. A crucial design dimension of LSM-tree is its compaction granularity. Some designs perform Full Merge, whereby entire levels get compacted at once. Others perform Partial Merge, whereby smaller groups of files with overlapping key ranges are compacted independently. This paper shows that both strategies exhibit serious flaws. With Full Merge, space-amplification is exorbitant. The reason is that while compacting the LSM-tree's largest level, there must be at least twice as much storage space as data to store both the original and new files until the compaction is finished. On the other hand, Partial Merge exhibits excessive write-amplification. The reason is twofold. (1) The files getting compacted typically do not have perfectly overlapping key ranges, and so some non-overlapping data is superfluously rewritten in each compaction. (2) Files with different lifetimes become interspersed within the SSD leading to high SSD garbage-collection overheads. As the data size grows, these problems grow in magnitude.",

        "Title": "Progressive Slice Recovery With Guaranteed Slice Connectivity After Massive Failures",
        "Abstract": "In presence of multiple failures affecting their network infrastructure, operators are faced with the Progressive Network Recovery (PNR) problem, i.e., deciding the best sequence of repairs during recovery. With incoming deployments of 5G networks, PNR must evolve to incorporate new recovery opportunities offered by network slicing. In this study, we introduce the new problem of Progressive Slice Recovery (PSR), which is addressed with eight different strategies, i.e., allowing or not to change slice embedding during the recovery, and/or by enforcing different versions of slice connectivity (i.e., network vs. content connectivity). We propose a comprehensive PSR scheme, which can be applied to all recovery strategies and achieves fast recovery of slices. We first prove the PSR&#x2019;s NP-hardness and design an integer linear programming (ILP) model, which can obtain the best recovery sequence and is extensible for all the recovery strategies. Then, to address scalability issues of the ILP model, we devise an efficient two-phases progressive slice recovery (2-phase PSR) meta-heuristic algorithm, small optimality gap, consisting of two main steps: i) determination of recovery sequence, achieved through a linear-programming relaxation that works in polynomial time; and ii) slice-embedding recovery, for which we design an auxiliary-graph-based column generation to re-embed failed slice nodes/links to working substrate elements within a given number of actions. Numerical results compare the different strategies and validate that amount of recovered slices can be improved up to 50&#x0025; if operators decide to reconfigure only few slice nodes and guarantee content connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in an untended environment and the openness of the wireless channel bring various security threats to WSN. The resource limitations of the sensor nodes make the conventional security systems less attractive for WSN. Moreover, conventional cryptography alone cannot ensure the desired security against the physical attacks on sensor nodes. Physically unclonable function (PUF) is an emerging hardware security primitive that provides low-cost hardware security exploiting the unique inherent randomness of a device. In this article, we have proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for the WSN integrating Pedersen\u2019s verifiable secret sharing (Pedersen\u2019s VSS) and Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (Shamir\u2019s SS) scheme with PUF which ensure the desired security with low overhead. The security analysis depicts the resilience of the proposed scheme against different active, passive and physical attacks. Also, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme possesses low computation, communication and storage overhead. The scheme only needs to store a polynomial number of PUF challenge-response pairs to the user node. The sink or senor nodes do not require storing any secret key. Finally, the comparison with the previous protocols establishes the dominance of the proposed scheme to use in WSN.",

        "Title": "Certificateless Homomorphic Signature Scheme for Network Coding",
        "Abstract": "Homomorphic signature is an extremely important public key authentication technique for network coding to defend against pollution attacks. As a public key cryptographic primitive, it also encounters the same problem of how to confirm the relationship between some public key <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$pk$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the identity <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ID$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of its owner. In the setting of distributed network coding, the intermediate and destination nodes need to use the public key of source node S to check the validity of vector-signature pairs. Therefore, the binding of S and its corresponding public key becomes crucial. The popular and traditional solution is based on certificates which are issued by a trusted certification authority (CA) center. However, the generation and management of certificates is extremely cumbersome. Hence, in recent work, Lin <italic>et al.</italic> proposed a new notion of identity-based homomorphic signature, which intends to avoid using certificates. But the key escrow problem is inevitable for identity-based primitives. In this article, we propose another new notion (for network coding): certificateless homomorphic signature (CLHS), which is a compromise for the above two techniques. In particular, we first describe the definition and security model of certificateless homomorphic signature. Then based on bilinear map and the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption, give a concrete implementation and detailedly analyze its security. Finally, performance analysis illustrates that our construction is practical.",

        "Abstract": "Truth discovery is an effective paradigm which could reveal the truth from crowdsouced data with conflicts, enabling data-driven decision-making systems to make quick and smart decisions. The increasing privacy concern promotes users to perturb or encrypt their private data before outsourcing, which poses significant challenges for truth discovery. Although several privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanisms have been proposed, none of them take personal privacy expectation into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel personalized privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPPTD) framework over crowdsourced data streams to achieve timely and accurate truth discovery while guaranteeing the protection of individual privacy. The key challenges of PPPTD lie in improving the accuracy of truth estimation from the perturbed streaming data with personalized protection level. To address these challenges, we first develop a personalized budget initialization mechanism to quantify each user&#x2019;s privacy protection requirement, and allocate personalized privacy budgets to users according to their privacy requirements. Then we propose a deviation-aware weighted aggregation method to improve the accuracy of truth discovery from streaming data with varying degrees of perturbation. In order to achieve privacy-utility tradeoff, we further propose an influence-aware adaptive budget adjustment mechanism that adaptively re-allocates privacy budgets to users based on the evolution of their influence in the weighted aggregation. We prove that PPPTD can achieve <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-differential privacy over the whole data generated by users and satisfy individual personalized privacy requirements. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PPPTD.",

        "Abstract": "As one of the essential applications of health information technology, the eHealth system plays a significant role in enabling various internet medicine service scenes, most of which primarily rely on service recommendation or an evaluation mechanism. To avoid privacy leakage, some privacy-preserving mechanisms must be adopted to protect raters\u2019 privacy and make evaluation trust reliable. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes an efficient service recommendation and evaluation scheme, called EPRT, which is based on a similarity calculation and trust discovery method. This scheme uses homomorphic encryption technology to encrypt the sensitive data and combines the threshold mechanism and double-trap mechanism to realize the secure computing on the encrypted data, so as to ensure that the plaintexts of the final calculation results (e.g., recommendation value and evaluation truth) are only obtained by the authorized subject. In addition, a detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EPRT scheme can achieve the expected security. In addition, performance comparison results are carried out, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.",

        "Abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of authenticating the transmitter device in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This problem is important because of high vulnerabilities in wireless communications and an additional security vulnerability when some users collude with the adversary. In this paper, we consider two attacking scenarios. In the first scenario, there is no user that colludes with the adversary. In the second scenario, at least one user colludes with the adversary. In this paper, we propose an authentication approach in the down-link scheme of a NOMA system using physical-layer authentication mechanism because of its advantages: provide information theoretic security, reduce complexity, save power and allow us to construct a two-factor authentication system. Based on the aforementioned two attacking scenarios, we propose three physical-layer authentication schemes for a NOMA system: Physical-Layer Authentication with Shared Authentication Tag (PLA-SAT), Physical-Layer Authentication with Superimposed Independent authentication Tags (PLA-SIT), and Physical-Layer Authentication with TDM authentication tags (PLA-TDM). We analyze the theoretical performance of our schemes over fading channels and derive their closed-form expressions. Then, we optimize the parameters of our schemes to achieve both the reliability fairness and the authentication-accuracy fairness. We implemented our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparisons. Our experimental results show that for the first attacking scenario, the PLA-SAT scheme offers more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 10 dB. For the second attacking scenario, both the PLA-SIT scheme and the PLA-TDM scheme offer more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 12 dB.",

However, health data sharing poses several security issues, such as access control and privacy leakage, as well as faces critical challenges to obtain efficient data analysis and services. In this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fog-assisted health data sharing (PFHDS) scheme for e-healthcare systems. Specifically, we integrate the fog node to classify the shared data into different categories according to disease risks for efficient health data analysis. Meanwhile, we design an enhanced attribute-based encryption method through combination of a personal access policy on patients and a professional access policy on the fog node for effective medical service provision. Furthermore, we achieve significant encryption consumption reduction for patients by offloading a portion of the computation and storage burden from patients to the fog node. Security discussions show that PFHDS realizes data confidentiality and fine-grained access control with collusion resistance. Performance evaluations demonstrate cost-efficient encryption computation, storage and energy consumption.",

        "Title": "Merlin: A Language for Managing Network Resources",
        "Abstract": "This paper presents Merlin, a framework for managing resources in software-defined networks. With Merlin, administrators express high-level policies using programs in a declarative language. The language includes logical predicates to identify sets of packets, regular expressions to encode forwarding paths, and arithmetic formulas to specify bandwidth constraints. The compiler maps these policies into a constraint problem that determines bandwidth allocations using parametrizable heuristics. It then generates a code that can be executed on the network elements to enforce the policies. To allow network tenants to dynamically adapt policies to their needs, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Experiments demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of Merlin on realistic scenarios. Overall, Merlin simplifies network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying and enforcing network policies.",

        "Abstract": "Network K-function has been the de facto operation for analyzing point patterns in spatial networks, which is widely used in many communities, including geography, ecology, transportation science, social science, and criminology. To analyze a location dataset, domain experts need to generate a network K-function plot that involves computing multiple network K-functions. However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions. In addition, we incorporate the advanced shortest path sharing (ASPS) approach into these two methods to further lower the worst-case time complexity for generating network K-function plots. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets (up to 7.33 million data points) show that our methods can achieve up to 165.85x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Abstract": "Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. Based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default Dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is progressively becoming an essential aspect of daily life that can be sensed anywhere and anytime, transforming the traditional lifestyle into a high-tech one. Numerous applications in the edge are brought to life based on IoT infrastructures. Especially, edge computing has witnessed the proliferation and impact of IoT-enabled devices benefiting from the data collection and computation capabilities of IoT. However, establishing an IoT from scratch can be monetarily expensive, and leasing the existing sub-networks confronts the potentially dishonest behavior of service providers. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework of leasing edge IoT networks and analyze the influence of sub-network owners\u2019 dishonest behavior on the network. We model the interaction between the edge user and the owners of sub-networks by a Stackelberg game with a unique equilibrium, jointly analyzing the pricing and data collection mechanisms. The Primal-dual Decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analyses are provided for the corresponding strategies of the edge user and sub-network owners. Evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in the leasing model can save data collection cost up to 53% compared with existing data collection strategies, and illustrate the difference in network performance compared with the game without dishonest owners.",

        "Abstract": "Smart government (SG) is an emerging topic, which increasingly attracts attention from scholars who work in public administration, political, and information sciences. Smart city (SC) on the other hand, is an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of study. It is not clear whether the two terms SG and SC co-exist or concern different domains that interrelate and interact. The aim of this paper is to investigate the term SG; to conceptualize it with components; to define the importance of these components to the SG with their relative strengths; and to clarify its relationship with the SC term. In this respect, this paper follows a multi-method approach: a comprehensive literature review to define and conceptualize the SG, and determine its components, and a Delphi study for validating the literature findings and for calculating the relative components\u2019 strengths. The SG definitions that are in literature have several weaknesses and the authors proposed a definition to the SG that overcomes them, while a model with three rings, three dimensions and 13 components conceptualizes it. The Delphi study showed that all the SG conceptual entities are useful, and highlighted that Citizens Engagement, Economic Growth, and Accountability are more important compared to the others, but it is hard to decide about the less important component. Third, the ICT Innovation entity appears to be the most important compared to emerging technologies and data. Finally, SC and SG are indeed related but, SC is proved to be a complimentary part of the broader SG term.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in cryptographic approaches, such as Functional Encryption and Attribute-based Encryption and their variants, have shown significant promise for enabling public clouds to provide secure computation and storage services for users\u2019 sensitive data. A crucial component of these approaches is a third-party authority (TPA) that must be trusted to set up public parameters, provide private key service, and so on. Components of deployed cryptographic mechanisms such as the certificate authorities (CAs), which are the TPAs of the underlying PKI for the SSL/TLS protocol, have faced several types of attacks (e.g., stealthy targeted and censorship attacks), and certificate mis-issuance problems. Such practical challenges indicate that the successful deployment of newer emerging cryptographic schemes will also significantly depend on the trustworthiness of the TPAs. Furthermore, recently proposed decentralized TPA approaches that lower the threshold on the conditions required for an entity to become an authority can make the trust issue much worse. To address this issue, we propose an authority transparency framework to ensure the trustworthiness of TPAs of recent and emerging advanced cryptographic schemes. The framework includes a formal model and a secure logging-based approach to implement the framework. Further, to address the issues related to privacy, we also present a privacy-preserving authority transparency approach. We present security analysis and performance evaluation to show that authority transparency achieves the security and performance goals.",

We present LayerCode, a tagging scheme that embeds a carefully designed barcode pattern in 3D printed objects as a deliberate byproduct of the 3D printing process. The LayerCode concept is inspired by the structural resemblance between the parallel black and white bars of the standard barcode and the universal layer-by-layer approach of 3D printing. We introduce an encoding algorithm that enables the 3D printing layers to carry information without altering the object geometry. We also introduce a decoding algorithm that reads the LayerCode tag of a physical object by just taking a photo. The physical deployment of LayerCode tags is realized on various types of 3D printers, including Fused Deposition Modeling printers as well as Stereolithography based printers. Each offers its own advantages and tradeoffs. We show that LayerCode tags can work on complex, nontrivial shapes, on which all previous tagging mechanisms may fail. To evaluate LayerCode thoroughly, we further stress test it with a large dataset of complex shapes using virtual rendering. Among 4,835 tested shapes, we successfully encode and decode on more than 99% of the shapes.",

However, certification validation incurs non-trivial overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, because it either brings long latency or large cache space. This work proposes to utilize the power of distributed caching and explores the feasibility of using the cache spaces on all IoT devices as a large pool to store validated certificates. We design a Collaborative Certificate Validation (CCV) protocol including a memory-efficient and fast locator for certificate holders, a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of devices, and a protocol suite for dynamic update and certificate revocation. Evaluation results show that CCV only uses less than 25% validation time and reduces &gt;90% decryption operations on each device, compared to a recent method. Malicious devices that conduct dishonest validations can be detected by the network using the proposed trust model.",

        "Title": "Machine Learning-Enabled IoT Security: Open Issues and Challenges Under Advanced Persistent Threats",
        "Abstract": "Despite its technological benefits, the Internet of Things (IoT) has cyber weaknesses due to vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine Larning (ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with promising performance. An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is prominent for cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-term and harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys that fully investigate APT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth bridging the state of the art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security challenges in IoT networks and presents well-known attacks, APT attacks, and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks. The article highlights statistical insights regarding frequently applied ML-based methods against network intrusion. Finally, open issues and challenges for common network intrusion and APT attacks are presented for future research.",

        "Abstract": "When pieces from an individual's personal information available online are connected over time and across multiple platforms, this more complete digital trace can give unintended insights into their life and opinions. In a data narrative interview study with 26 currently employed participants, we examined risks and harms to individuals and employers when others joined the dots between their online information. We discuss the themes of visibility and self-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy literacies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into people's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but of subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or (re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by showing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information to be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to individuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of privacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to what they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute to current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense making in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for interventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of combined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more proactive action about what is shared and not shared online.",

        "Title": "Efficiently Inferring Top-<italic>k</italic> Largest Monitoring Data Entries Based on Discrete Tensor Completion",
        "Abstract": "Network-wide monitoring is important for many network functions. Due to the need of sampling to reduce high measurement cost, system failure, and unavoidable data transmission loss, network monitoring systems suffer from the incompleteness of network monitoring data. Different from the traditional network monitoring data estimation problem which aims to infer all missing monitoring data entries with incomplete measurement data, we study a challenging problem of inferring the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest monitoring data entries. The recent study shows it is promising to more accurately interpolate the missing data with a 3-D tensor compared to that based on a 2-D matrix. Taking full advantage of the multilinear structures, we apply tensor completion to first recover the missing data and then find the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> data entries. To reduce the computational overhead, we propose a novel discrete tensor completion model which uses binary codes to represent the factor matrices. Based on the model, we further propose three novel techniques to speed up the whole top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> entry inference process: a discrete optimization algorithm to train the binary factor matrices, bit operations to facilitate quick missing data inference, and simplifying the finding of top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest entries with binary code partition. In our discrete tensor completion model, only one bit is needed to represent the entry in the factor matrices instead of a real value (32 bits) needed in traditional tensor completion model, thus the storage cost is reduced significantly. To quickly infer the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest data entries when measurement data arrive sequentially, we also propose a sliding window based online algorithm using the discrete tensor completion model. Extensive experiments using five real data sets and one synthetic data set demonstrate that compared with the state of art tensor completion algorithms, our discrete tensor completion algorithm can achieve similar top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> entry inference accuracy using significantly smaller time and storage space.",

        "Abstract": "We carry on investigating the line of research questioning the power of randomization for the design of distributed algorithms. In their seminal paper, Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993] established that, in the context of network computing in which all nodes execute the same algorithm in parallel, any construction task that can be solved locally by a randomized Monte-Carlo algorithm can also be solved locally by a deterministic algorithm. This result, however, holds only for distributed tasks such that the correctness of their solutions can be locally checked by a deterministic algorithm. In this article, we extend the result of Naor and Stockmeyer to a wider class of tasks. Specifically, we prove that the same derandomization result holds for every task such that the correctness of their solutions can be locally checked using a 2-sided error randomized Monte-Carlo algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Many applications such as smart metering and location based services pose strong privacy requirements but achieving privacy protection at the client side is a non-trial problem as payment for the services must be computed by the server at the end of each billing period. In this paper, we propose a privacy preservation and billing scheme termed PPDIR based on delayed information release. PPDIR relies on a novel group signature mechanism and the asymmetric Rabin cryptosystem to protect the privacy of the clients and their requests, to achieve accountability and non-repudiation, and to shift the computational complexity to the server side. It adopts a secret token for anonymity and the token is updated for each client at the beginning of each billing period and securely released only to the server at the end of the billing period. Such a strategy can prevent the server from linking a client&#x2019;s requests made at different billing periods. It also prevents any adversary from linking any request to any client. Note that the server is able to figure out all requests made by a client within a billing period after receiving the delayed token, which is unavoidable for billing purpose. We prove the security properties of the group signature scheme, and analyze the security strength of PPDIR. Our study indicates that PPDIR can achieve privacy-preservation, confidentiality, non-repudiation, accountability, and other security objectives. We also evaluate the performance of our scheme in terms of communication and computational overheads.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet-of-Things IoT has inspired numerous new applications ever since its invention. Nevertheless, its development and utilization have always been restricted by the limited resources in various application scenarios. In this paper, we study the problem of resource provisioning for real-time IoT applications, i.e., applications that process concurrent data streams from data sources in the network. We investigate joint application placement and data routing to support IoT applications that have both quality-of-service and robustness requirements. We formulate four versions of the provisioning problem, spanning across two important classes of real-time applications parallelizable and non-parallelizable, and two provisioning scenarios single application and multiple applications. All versions are proved to be NP-hard. We propose fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for three of the four versions, and a randomized algorithm for the forth. Through simulation experiments, we analyze the impact of parallelizability and robustness on the provisioning performance, and show that our proposed algorithms can greatly improve the quality-of-service of the IoT applications.",

Wealthy students enjoy value in the form of financial capital; their fit to hegemonic social practices; excellent health care and so on. Low-income students, especially those from African American, Native American, and Latinx communities, often lack access to those resources. But there are other forms of value that low-income students do possess. Most examples of what we will call Counter-Hegemonic Practice (CHP) in the African American community involve some mixture of Indigenous African heritage, contemporary innovation in the Black community, and other influences. Moving between these value forms and the computing classroom is a non-trivial task, especially if we are to avoid merely using the appearance of culture to attract students. Our objective in this paper is to provide a framework for deeper investigations into the computational potentials for CHP; its potential as a link between education and community development; and a more dignified role for its utilization in the CS classroom. We report on a series of collaborative engagements with CHP, largely focused on African American communities.",

It poses great challenges (<italic>e.g.</italic> accuracy, reliability, stability) on the real-time analysis and decision making for different IoT applications. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate EdgeLSTM, a unified data-driven system to enhance IoT computing at the network edge. The EdgeLSTM leverages the grid long short-term memory (Grid LSTM) to provide an agile solution for both deep and sequential computation, therefore can address important features such as large-scale, variety, time dependency and real time in IoT data. Our system exploits the advantages of Grid LSTM network and extends it with a multiclass support vector machine by rigorous regularization and optimization approaches, which not only has strong prediction capability of time series data, but also achieves fine-grained multiple classification through the predictive error. We deploy the EdgeLSTM into four IoT applications, including data prediction, anomaly detection, network maintenance and mobility management by extensive experiments. Our evaluation results of real-world time series data with different short-term and long-term time dependency from these typical IoT applications show that our EdgeLSTM system can guarantee robust performance in IoT computing.",

        "Abstract": "Data exchange between organizations is becoming an increasingly significant issue due to the great opportunities it presents. However, there is great reluctance to share if data sovereignty is not provided. Providing it calls for not only access control but also usage control implemented in distributed systems. Access control is a research field where there has been a great deal of work, but usage control, especially implemented in distributed systems as Distributed Usage Control (DUC), is a very new field of research that presents great challenges. Moreover, little is known about what challenges must really be faced and how they must be addressed. This is evidenced by the fact that existing research has focused non-specifically on different features of DUC, which are not formalized. Therefore, the path for the development of DUC solutions is unclear and it is difficult to analyze the scope of data sovereignty attained by the wide range of DUC solutions. In this context, this article is based on an initial in-depth analysis of DUC related work. In it, the challenges posed by DUC in terms of data sovereignty and the features that must be provided to address them are identified and analyzed for the first time. Based on these features, an initial DUC framework is proposed to assess in a practical and unified way the extent to which DUC solutions provide data sovereignty. Finally, the assessment framework is applied to compare the scopes of the most widespread DUC solutions and identify their limitations.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid proliferation of personalized mobile Apps, which poses a pressing need for user experience improvement. A promising solution is to model App usage by learning semantic-aware App usage representations which can capture the relation among time, locations and Apps. However, it is non-trivial due to the complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity characteristics of App usage. To smooth over these obstacles and achieve the goal, we propose SA-GCN, a novel representation learning model to map Apps, location, and time units into dense embedding vectors considering spatio-temporal characteristics and unit properties simultaneously. To handle complexity and dynamics, we build an App usage graph by regarding App, time, and location units as nodes and their co-occurrence relations as edges. For heterogeneity, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units into the semantic-aware representations. We evaluate the performance of SA-GCN via a large-scale real-world dataset. In-depth analysis shows that SA-GCN characterizes the complex relationships among different units and recover meaningful spatio-temporal patterns. Moreover, we make use of the learned representations in App usage prediction task without post-training and achieve 8.3% of the performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "Abstract": "As timing delay becomes a critical issue in chip performance, there is a burning desire for IC design under smart manufacturing to optimize the delay. As the best connection model for multi-terminal nets, the wirelength and the maximum source-to-sink pathlength of the Steiner minimum tree are the decisive factors of timing delay for routing. In addition, considering that X-routing can get the utmost out of routing resources, this article proposes a Timing-Driven X-routing Steiner Minimum Tree (TD-XSMT) algorithm based on two-stage competitive particle swarm optimization. This work utilizes the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and redesigns its framework, thus improving its performance. First, a two-stage learning strategy is presented, which balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the particle by learning edge structures and pseudo-Steiner point choices. Especially in the second stage, a hybrid crossover strategy is designed to guarantee convergence quality. Second, the competition mechanism is adopted to select particle learning objects and enhance diversity. Finally, according to the characteristics of the discrete TD-XSMT problem, the mutation and crossover operators of the genetic algorithm are used to effectively discretize the proposed algorithm. Experimental results reveal that TSCPSO-TD-XSMT can obtain a smooth trade-off between wirelength and maximum source-to-sink pathlength, and achieve distinguished timing delay optimization.",

        "Abstract": "Data isolation has become an obstacle to scale up query processing over big data, since sharing raw data among data owners is often prohibitive due to security concerns. A promising solution is to perform secure queries over a federation of multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques, as evidenced by recent federation work over relational data. However, existing solutions are highly inefficient on spatial queries due to excessive secure distance operations for query processing and their usage of general-purpose SMC libraries for secure operation implementation. In this paper, we propose Hu-Fu, the first system for efficient and secure spatial query processing on a data federation. The idea is to decompose the secure processing of a spatial query into as many plaintext operations and as few secure operations as possible, where fewer secure operators are involved and all secure operators are implemented dedicatedly. As a working system, Hu-Fu supports not only query input in native SQL, but also heterogeneous spatial databases (e.g., PostGIS, Simba, GeoMesa, and SpatialHadoop) at the backend. Extensive experiments show that Hu-Fu usually outperforms the state-of-the-arts in running time and communication cost while guaranteeing security.",

        "Abstract": "5G NR is designed to operate over a broad range of frequency bands and support new applications with ultra-low latency requirements. To support its extremely diverse operating conditions, multiple OFDM numerologies have been defined in the 5G standards. Under these numerologies, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. This requirement poses a new challenge beyond existing LTE and cannot be satisfied by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF&#x002B;, which is a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler with timing performance under <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. GPF&#x002B; is an improvement over our GPF in Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (2018). The key ideas include decomposing the original scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF&#x002B; on an off-the-shelf NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, we show that GPF&#x002B; is able to achieve near-optimal PF performance with timing performance under <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. GPF&#x002B; represents the fastest GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new real-time requirement in 5G NR.",

        "Abstract": "BGP reconvergence events involving a large number of prefixes may result in the loss of large amounts of traffic. Based on the observation that a very small number of prefixes carries the vast majority of traffic, we propose Power Prefixes Prioritization (PPP) to ensure the routes of these popular BGP prefixes converge first. By doing so, we significantly reduce the amount of traffic lost during reconvergence events. To achieve this, PPP obtains an ordered list of popular prefixes through traffic inspection, and configures the resulting prefix rank in the BGP routers to prioritize the processing and advertisement of BGP routes. We model the benefits of PPP over traditional BGP processing in terms of traffic loss for both generic and a Zipf traffic distribution, and we consider the impact of sampling in the process of obtaining the prefix rank. Applying the mechanism to real traffic traces obtained from WIDE, we show that PPP reduces the amount of traffic lost by an order of magnitude, even when we configure it to use conservative sampling rates. We prototype our proposal in Quagga to show the feasibility of its implementation, and we observe similar traffic loss reduction. PPP can be deployed incrementally, as it is implemented purely as a change in the router-internal BGP processing behavior.",

        "Title": "Effective indexing for dynamic structural graph clustering",
        "Abstract": "Graph clustering is a fundamental data mining task that clusters vertices into different groups. The structural graph clustering algorithm (SCAN) is a widely used graph clustering algorithm that derives not only clustering results, but also special roles of vertices like hubs and outliers. In this paper, we consider structural graph clustering on dynamic graphs under Jaccard similarity. The state-of-the-art index-based solution focuses on static graphs and incurs prohibitive update costs to maintain indices. Lately, an efficient approximate dynamic structural graph clustering algorithm Dyn-StrClu under Jaccard similarity is proposed. However, their solution needs to fix input parameters while parameter settings of SCAN usually need to be fine-tuned to achieve good clustering results.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing is a new paradigm in which a requester can recruit a group of mobile users via a platform and coordinate them to perform some sensing tasks by using their smartphones. In mobile crowdsensing, each user might perform multiple tasks with different sensing qualities. Meanwhile, the users participating in the crowdsensing will ask for sufficient rewards to compensate for their expenditures. Hence, an important problem is how to recruit the users with minimum cost while achieving a satisfactory sensing quality for each task. Furthermore, in order to ease users&#x2019; worries about privacy disclosures, the user recruitment process needs to protect each user&#x2019;s sensing quality and recruitment cost information from being revealed to other users or to the platform. In this paper, we propose two secure user recruitment problems for the cases where the recruitment costs of users are homogeneous and heterogeneous. After proving the NP-hardness of the problems, we design two secure user recruitment protocols by using secret sharing scheme. Both of the proposed protocols adopt greedy strategies, which can recruit nearly optimal users while ensuring that the total sensing quality of each task is no less than a given threshold. The difference lies in that the two greedy strategies are based on two unique utility functions. We analyze the approximation ratios of the two protocols and prove the security under the semi-honest model. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed protocols through extensive simulations and executions on real smartphones.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, network function virtualization has been proposed to transform from network hardware appliances to software middleboxes. Normally, a demand needs to invoke several virtual network functions VNFs following the order determined by the service chain along a routing path. In this paper, we study the joint problem of the VNF placement and path selection to better utilize the network. We discover that the relation between the link and server usage plays a crucial role in the problem. Inspired by stress testing, we first propose a systematic way to elastically tune the link and server usage of each demand based on the network status and properties of demands. In particular, we compute a proper routing path length, and decide, for each VNF in the service chain, whether to use additional server resources or to reuse resources provided by existing servers. We then propose a chain deployment algorithm that follows the guidance of this link and server usage. Via simulations, we show that our design effectively adapts resource allocation to network dynamics and, hence, serves more demands than other heuristics.",

        "Abstract": "The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgment. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios. In this paper, we present a new acknowledgment called TACK (&#x201C;Tame ACK&#x201D;), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TACK seeks to minimize ACK frequency, which is exactly what is required by transport. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90&#x0025; of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of up to 28&#x0025; on goodput. A TACK-based protocol is a good replacement of the legacy TCP to compensate for scenarios where the acknowledgment overhead is non-negligible.",

        "Abstract": "Owing to its nature of scalability and privacy by design, federated learning (FL) has received increasing interest in decentralized deep learning. FL has also facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized recommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant model, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems (FRSs) do not take into account the lack of resources and data availability at the end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices (i.e., users), and that all local recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user\u2019s behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources. Furthermore, users\u2019 preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System (ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified user preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning a user\u2019s temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server side, ReFRS utilizes a scalable semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation within each identified cluster of similar users. The clustering module operates in an asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by comparative experiments on real datasets.",

        "Abstract": "This article attempts to bridge the gap between widely discussed ethical principles of Human-centered AI (HCAI) and practical steps for effective governance. Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.",

        "Abstract": "Location-aware viral marketing is crucial in modern commercial applications for attracting customers to certain points of interests. Prior works are mainly based on formulating it into a location-aware influence maximization problem in Geo-social Networks GSNs, where $K$ initial seed individuals are selected in hope of maximizing the number of final influenced users. In this paper, we present the first look into the group-level location promotion, which can potentially enhance its performance, with the phenomenon that users belonging to the same geo-community share similar moving preferences. We propose GLP, a new and novel framework of group-level location promotion by virtue of geo-communities, each of which is treated as a group in GSNs. Aiming to attract more users to designated locations, GLP firstly carries out user grouping through an iterative learning approach based on information extraction from massive check-ins records. The advantage of GLP is three-folded: i by aggregating movements of group members, GLP significantly avoids the sparsity and sporadicity of individual check-ins, and thus obtains more reliable mobility models; ii by generalizing a new group-level social graph, GLP can exponentially reduce the computational complexity of seed nodes selection that is algorithmically executed by a greedy algorithm; iii in comparison with prior individual-level cases, GLP is theoretically demonstrated to drastically increase influence spread under the same given budget. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the GLP outperforms four baselines, with notably up to 10 times larger influence spread and 100 times faster seed selection over two individual-level cases, meanwhile verifying the impact of group numbers in final influence spread.",

        "Title": "Characterizing Alternative Monetization Strategies on YouTube",
        "Abstract": "One of the key emerging roles of the YouTube platform is providing creators the ability to generate revenue from their content and interactions. Alongside tools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from advertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform monetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and characterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large longitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of alternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to detect their usage automatically. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these strategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive and increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels using one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of these strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and popularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams often become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how potentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and Manosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding that they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often than a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates YouTube's role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding policy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be effective. Overall, this work provides an important step toward broadening the understanding of the monetary incentives behind content creation on YouTube.",

        "Abstract": "Communication technologies have significant social impacts, and it is important to consider how designers' and developers' values shape their design. Increasingly, these technologies are released as continually evolving platforms and services, so their development involves ongoing discussions and debates about unforeseen problems and future directions. However, there is a gap in research about how designers, developers, and other stakeholders engage with values during later stages of development. We investigate discussions about values in the context of open source software development, focusing on projects related to the Decentralized Web. We conducted a large-scale analysis of GitHub issues among diverse yet ideologically-related projects. We show that the percentage of discussions about values increases later in development, and we identify features and outcomes of conflicts related to open source participants' values. Finally, we propose suggestions to improve upon existing discussion practices by supporting common ground among collaborators with diverse goals, perspectives, and experiences.",

        "Title": "Modeling, Analysis and Validation of Evolving Networks With Hybrid Interactions",
        "Abstract": "In many real-world networks, entities of different types usually form an evolving network with hybrid interactions. However, how to theoretically model such networks, along with quantitive characterizations, remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving model, which, as validated by our empirical results, can well capture some basic properties such as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter, and community structure embodied in most real datasets. Particularly, two types of results are presented in this paper. First, our proposed model, namely, evolving K-Graph, consists of $K$ -node sets representing $K$ different types of entities. The hybrid interactions among entities, based on whether they belong to the same type, are classified into inter-type and intra-type ones that are, respectively, characterized by two joint graphs evolving over time. Following our newly proposed mechanism called interactive-evolution, potential connections can be established among nodes with common features and further form a positive feedback. The superiorities of our model are three folded: good capture of realistic networks, mathematical tractability, and efficient implementation. Second, by analytical derivations, along with empirical validation on real datasets, we disclose two aspects of network properties: basic ones as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter and community structure, as well as a distinctive one, that is, positive correlation observed in real networks, implying that a hub in one inter-type relationship network also has many neighbors in another one. An additional interesting finding is that through further comparison of models with or without interactive-evolution, the former one leads to an even earlier occurrence of network connectivity.",

We provide an approach for representing the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appear in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and the relationships among them as provenance queries that capture the attacker\u2019s malicious behavior. We use the kernel audit log as a reliable source for system activities and develop an optimized whole system provenance graph that provides the causal relationships and information flows among system entities in a compact format. Then, we model the threat hunting as a behavior match problem by applying provenance queries to the optimized provenance graph to find any hits as indicators of an APT attack. We evaluate APTHunter on adversarial engagements from DARPA over different OS platforms, as well as real-world APT campaigns. Based on our experimental results, APTHunter promptly and reliably detects attack artifacts in early stages.",

        "Title": "SEAD Counter: Self-Adaptive Counters With Different Counting Ranges",
        "Abstract": "The Sketch is a compact data structure useful for network measurements. However, to cope with the high speeds of the current data plane, it needs to be held in the small on-chip memory (SRAM). Therefore, the product of the counter size and the number of counters must be below a certain limit. With small counters, some will overflow. With large counters, the total number of counters will be small, but each counter will be shared by more flows, leading to poor accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a generic technique: <italic>self-adaptive counters (SEAD Counter)</italic>. When the value of the counter is small, it works as a standard counter. When the value of the counter is large however, we increment it using a predefined probability, so as to represent this large value. Moreover, in the SEAD Counter, the probability decreases when the value increases. We show that this technique can significantly improve the accuracy of counters. This technique can be adapted to different circumstances. We theoretically analyze the improvements achieved by the SEAD Counter. We further show that our SEAD Counter can be extended to three typical sketches and Bloom filters. We conduct extensive experiments on three real datasets and one synthetic dataset. The experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art, sketches using the SEAD Counter improve the accuracy by up to 13.6 times, while the Bloom filters using SEAD Counter can reduce the false positive rate by more than one order of magnitude.",

        "Abstract": "In networks where massive sources make observations of same entities, we intend to seek the <italic>truth</italic> &#x2013; the most trustworthy value of each entity from conflicting information claimed by multiple sources. Various methods are proposed for accurately inferring both source reliability and truths, yet relying heavily on centralized settings that incur tremendous overhead to source side. In this paper, we offer a <italic>decentralized</italic> design of truth discovery task that can fit favorably to the environments with limited resources. Considering that sources forming the connected network and making individual observations, we undertake the joint maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of truth and source reliability. Our decentralization framework simply allows each source to maintain local information exchange at a time, and computes very basic functions of data observations. To this end, we facilitate the decentralization by simplifying the MLE problem into optimizing an objective function. Upon the proof of NP-hardness, two proposed decentralized algorithms (exact and approximation) are decentralized and randomized via a combination of algorithms from their centralized counterparts that ensure performance guarantee. The derived time complexity features explicit data/network dependent terms, which leads to further acceleration in truth finding. Remarkably, in two well connected networks like random geometric and preferential attachment graphs, the accelerated approximation method enjoys logarithmic time complexity while preserving comparable accuracy to the centralized counterparts. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralizations are further empirically confirmed.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot cope with the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Due to their high false-positive rate and the required effort of security experts to validate them, incidents can remain undetected for up to several months. As a result, enterprises suffer from data loss and severe financial damage. Recent research explored data provenance for Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) as one promising data source to tackle this issue. Data provenance represents information flows between system entities as Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG). Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) utilize data provenance to enhance the detection performance of intrusions and reduce false-alarm rates compared to traditional IDS. This survey demonstrates the potential of PIDS by providing a detailed evaluation of recent research in the field, proposing a novel taxonomy for PIDS, discussing current issues, and potential future research directions. This survey aims to help and motivate researchers to get started in the field of PIDS by tackling issues of data collection, graph summarization, intrusion detection, and developing real-world benchmark datasets.",

        "Title": "Fuzzing: A Survey for Roadmap",
        "Abstract": "Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth.

        "Abstract": "Serverless computing has emerged as an attractive deployment option for cloud applications in recent times. The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions. This model is increasingly being explored for deployments in geographically distributed edge and fog computing networks as well, due to these characteristics. Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks. We also analyse existing works discussing aspects of serverless resource management using this taxonomy.

        "Title": "Cybersecurity of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems: A Review",
        "Abstract": "Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the \u201cphysics\u201d data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Social media embeddedness relationships consist of online social networks formed by self-organized individual actors and significantly affect many aspects of our lives. Since the high cost and inefficiency of using population networks generated by social media embeddedness relationships to study practical issues, sampling techniques have become increasingly important than ever. Our work consists of three parts. We first comprehensively analyze current sampling selection methods, evaluation indexes, and evaluation methods in terms of technological evolution. In the second part, we systematically conduct sampling tests using representative large-scale social media datasets. The test results indicate that unequal-probability sampling methods can construct similar sample networks at the macroscale and microscale and outperform the equal-probability methods. However, non-negligible sampling errors at the mesoscale seriously affect the sampling reliability and validity. MANOVA tests show that the direct cause of sampling errors is the low in-degree nodes with medium-high betweenness located between the core and periphery, and current sampling methods cannot accurately sample such complex interconnected structures. In the third part, we summarize the pros and cons of current sampling methods and provide suggestions for future work.",

        "Abstract": "The appetite for effective use of information assets has been steadily rising in both public and private sector organisations. However, whether the information is used for social good or commercial gain, there is a growing recognition of the complex socio-technical challenges associated with balancing the diverse demands of regulatory compliance and data privacy, social expectations and ethical use, business process agility and value creation, and scarcity of data science talent. In this vision paper, we present a series of case studies that highlight these interconnected challenges, across a range of application areas. We use the insights from the case studies to introduce Information Resilience, as a scaffold within which the competing requirements of responsible and agile approaches to information use can be positioned. The aim of this paper is to develop and present a manifesto for Information Resilience that can serve as a reference for future research and development in relevant areas of responsible data management.",

        "Title": "Towards a unified proof framework for automated fixpoint reasoning using matching logic",
        "Abstract": "Automation of fixpoint reasoning has been extensively studied for various mathematical structures, logical formalisms, and computational domains, resulting in specialized fixpoint provers for heaps, for streams, for term algebras, for temporal properties, for program correctness, and for many other formal systems and inductive and coinductive properties. However, in spite of great theoretical and practical interest, there is no unified framework for automated fixpoint reasoning. Although several attempts have been made, there is no evidence that such a unified framework is possible, or practical. In this paper, we propose a candidate based on matching logic, a formalism recently shown to theoretically unify the above mentioned formal systems. Unfortunately, the (Knaster-Tarski) proof rule of matching logic, which enables inductive reasoning, is not syntax-driven. Worse, it can be applied at any step during a proof, making automation seem hopeless. Inspired by recent advances in automation of inductive proofs in separation logic, we propose an alternative proof system for matching logic, which is amenable for automation. We then discuss our implementation of it, which although not superior to specialized state-of-the-art automated provers for specific domains, we believe brings some evidence and hope that a unified framework for automated reasoning is not out of reach.",

        "Abstract": "Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) is a mechanism of informal collaborative savings that is widely used across the globe. Despite its popularity and prevalence, it is not well-studied from HCI and CSCW perspectives. The global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based Digital Financial Services (DFS) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any DFS-based interventions around ROSCAs. In this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and opportunities for their digitization in the Pakistani context. We also present a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. The platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. We present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups). We find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional ROSCAs by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. It also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility.",

        "Abstract": "In the current COVID-19 pandemic, manual contact tracing has been proven to be very helpful to reach close contacts of infected users and slow down spread of the virus. To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users\u2019 contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments.",

        "Title": "Learning semantic program embeddings with graph interval neural network",
        "Abstract": "Learning distributed representations of source code has been a challenging task for machine learning models. Earlier works treated programs as text so that natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such approaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by source code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn embeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous (i.e. do not take advantage of the program-specific graph characteristics) and expensive (i.e. require heavy information exchange among nodes in the graph) message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues, especially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this paper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural Network (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained through an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular, GINN focuses exclusively on intervals (generally manifested in looping construct) for mining the feature representation of a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs.",

        "Abstract": "Timed automata are a common formalism for the verification of concurrent systems subject to timing constraints. They extend finite-state automata with clocks, that constrain the system behavior in locations, and to take transitions. While timed automata were originally designed for safety (in the wide sense of correctness w.r.t. a formal property), they were progressively used in a number of works to guarantee security properties. In this work, we review works studying security properties for timed automata over the past two decades. We notably review theoretical works, with a particular focus on opacity, as well as more practical works, with a particular focus on attack trees and their extensions. We derive main conclusions concerning open perspectives, as well as tool support.",

        "Title": "A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Funder Trust and Due Diligence Processes in Online Crowdfunding Investment",
        "Abstract": "We report on two studies undertaken to establish the factors that affect funders\u2019 trust and likelihood to invest in crowdfunding campaigns online. Findings from an initial small-scale qualitative study are reported and subsequently triangulated in a larger quantitative survey. Across these studies, we demonstrate the importance of social information within the peer economy, with a strong reliance on other users across the course of the investment decision-making process. Decision making on whether to invest is informed not only by the content of the crowdfunding campaign page but also by social influence factors that are present (e.g., liking of the campaigner, reciprocity). It is further shaped by due diligence checks focused on the progression of the prototype for which funding is sought, and by assurances from outside the campaign page\u2014namely on social media. Such assurances center around the importance of social proof, garnered through opinions of previous customers or other funders. The risk here is that much of this information is content that can be faked, and as such a reliance on this may leave potential funders vulnerable. Meanwhile, a genuine lack of prior experience and customer base means that some legitimate campaigners struggle to gain trust from potential investors who are reliant on such social information. Our findings present an empirical grounding to develop future security solutions that (1) protect existing funders and (2) increase potential funders\u2019 level of trust, to encourage their engagement with legitimate crowdfunding campaigns.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.",

        "Abstract": "Devices such as phones, laptops and tablets have become central to the ways in which many people communicate with others, conduct business and spend their leisure time. This type of product uniquely contains both physical and digital components that affect how they are perceived and valued by users. This article investigates the nature of attachment in the context of technological possessions to better understand ways in which designers can create devices that are meaningful and kept for longer. Findings from our study of the self-reported associations and meaningfulness of technological possessions revealed that the digital contents of these possessions were often the primary source of meaning. Technological possessions were frequently perceived as systems of products rather than as singular devices. We identified several design opportunities for materialising the associations ascribed to the digital information contained within technological products to more meaningfully integrate their physical and digital components.",

        "Abstract": "In the current hyperconnected era, modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people interact with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and participatory role. Such Human-Machine Networks (HMNs) are embedded in the daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs. Moreover, we discuss risks associated with HMNs and identify emerging design and development trends.",

Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.",

        "Abstract": "Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it), to hiring services (e.g. distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets, and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out over from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more towards the business side of botnets, which could contribute towards eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.",

        "Abstract": "As connectivity between and within vehicles increases, so does concern about safety and security. Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches. We conclude with mitigation strategies limitations and research challenges for the future.",

        "Abstract": "We are surrounded by increasingly complex networks of smart objects, yet our understanding and attachment to them is rather limited. One way to support stronger end users\u2019 engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users\u2019 DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.",

        "Abstract": "The security and privacy of smart home systems, particularly from a home user\u2019s perspective, have been a very active research area in recent years. However, via a meta-review of 52 review papers covering related topics (published between 2000 and 2021), this paper shows a lack of a more recent literature review on user perspectives of smart home security and privacy since the 2010s. This identified gap motivated us to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 126 relevant research papers published from 2010 to 2021. Our SLR led to the discovery of a number of important areas where further research is needed; these include holistic methods that consider a more diverse and heterogeneous range of home devices, interactions between multiple home users, complicated data flow between multiple home devices and home users, some less-studied demographic factors, and advanced conceptual frameworks. Based on these findings, we recommended key future research directions, e.g., research for a better understanding of security and privacy aspects in different multi-device and multi-user contexts, and a more comprehensive ontology on the security and privacy of the smart home covering varying types of home devices and behaviors of different types of home users.",

        "Abstract": "The last decade has sparked several valiant efforts in deductive verification of distributed agreement protocols such as consensus and leader election. Oddly, there have been far fewer verification efforts that go beyond the core protocols and target applications that are built on top of agreement protocols. This is unfortunate, as agreement-based distributed services such as data stores, locks, and ledgers are ubiquitous and potentially permit modular, scalable verification approaches that mimic their modular design. We address this need for verification of distributed agreement-based systems through our novel modeling and verification framework, QuickSilver, that is not only modular, but also fully automated. The key enabling feature of QuickSilver is our encoding of abstractions of verified agreement protocols that facilitates modular, decidable, and scalable automated verification. We demonstrate the potential of QuickSilver by modeling and efficiently verifying a series of tricky case studies, adapted from real-world applications, such as a data store, a lock service, a surveillance system, a pathfinding algorithm for mobile robots, and more.",

        "Title": "From Server-Based to Client-Based Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Survey",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, mobile devices have gained increasing development with stronger computation capability and larger storage space. Some of the computation-intensive machine learning tasks can now be run on mobile devices. To exploit the resources available on mobile devices and preserve personal privacy, the concept of client-based machine learning has been proposed. It leverages the users\u2019 local hardware and local data to solve machine learning sub-problems on mobile devices and only uploads computation results rather than the original data for the optimization of the global model. Such an architecture can not only relieve computation and storage burdens on servers but also protect the users\u2019 sensitive information. Another benefit is the bandwidth reduction because various kinds of local data can be involved in the training process without being uploaded. In this article, we provide a literature review on the progressive development of machine learning from server based to client based. We revisit a number of widely used server-based and client-based machine learning methods and applications. We also extensively discuss the challenges and future directions in this area. We believe that this survey will give a clear overview of client-based machine learning and provide guidelines on applying client-based machine learning to practice.",

        "Abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) incorporate different forms of interactive communication, including microblogging services, multimedia sharing, business networking, and so on. They allow users to create profiles, connect with friends, and share their daily activities and thoughts. However, this ease of use of OSNs comes with a cost in terms of users\u2019 privacy and security. The big amount of personal data shared in the users\u2019 profiles or correlated from their activities can be stored, processed, and sold for advertisement or statistical purposes. It attracts also malicious users who can collect and exploit the data and target different types of attacks. In this article, we review the state of the art of OSNs existing either in the literature or deployed for use. We focus on the OSN systems that offer, but not exclusively, microblogging services. We analyze and evaluate each system based on a set of characteristics, and we compare them based on their usability and the level of protection of privacy and security they provide. This study is a first step toward understanding the security and privacy controls and measuring their level in an OSN.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the ubiquitous nature of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications as well as the pervasive character of next-generation communication protocols, such as the 5G technology, have become widely evident. In this work, we identify the need for low-cost security in current and next-generation IoT networks and address this demand through the implementation, testing, and validation of an intrinsic low-cost and low-overhead hardware-based security primitive within an inherent network component. In particular, an intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is implemented in the peripheral network module of a tri-band commercial off-the-shelf router. Subsequently, we demonstrate the robustness of this PUF to ambient temperature variations and to limited natural aging, and examine in detail its potential for securing the next generation of IoT networks and other applications. Finally, the security of the proposed PUF-based schemes is briefly assessed and discussed.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people\u2019s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.",

These properties are analyzed using very different formal frameworks: expressive untimed and non-probabilistic frameworks, such as TLA+ and Hoare/separation logics, for qualitative properties; and timed/probabilistic-automaton-based ones, such as Uppaal and Prism, for quantitative ones. This requires developing two quite different models of the same system, without guarantees of semantic consistency between them. Furthermore, it is very hard or impossible to represent intrinsic features of distributed object systems\u2014such as unbounded data structures, dynamic object creation, and an unbounded number of messages\u2014using finite automata.",

        "Abstract": "IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) \u2014 virtual copies of physical objects and systems \u2014 can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we examine the fundamental and taken-for-granted infrastructures that make tech entrepreneurship possible. We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs\u2019 potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.",

        "Title": "From 'Friends with Benefits' to 'Sextortion:' A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents' Online Sexual Risk Experiences",
        "Abstract": "Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled teens to engage in a wider variety of potentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations, from normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13--17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of \"safe\" versus \"risky\". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.",

        "Abstract": "Multiple users have access to multiple devices in a smart home system \u2013 typically through a dedicated app installed on a mobile device. Traditional access control mechanisms consider one unique, trusted user that controls access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and dynamically-changing demands on multiple devices that cannot be handled by traditional access control techniques. Moreover, smart devices from different platforms/vendors can share the same home environment, making existing access control obsolete for smart home systems. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce Kratos+, a novel multi-user and multi-device-aware access control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access control demands. Kratos+ has four main components: user interaction module, backend server, policy manager, and policy execution module. Users can easily specify their desired access control settings using the interaction module that are translated into access control policies in the back-end server. The policy manager analyzes these policies, initiates automated negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands, and generates final policies to enforce in smart home systems. We implemented Kratos+ as a platform-independent solution and evaluated its performance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with a rich set of configurations (337 different policies including 231 demand conflicts and 69 restriction policies). These configurations also included five different threats associated with access control mechanisms. Our extensive evaluations show that Kratos+ is very effective in resolving conflicting access control demands with minimal overhead. We also performed an extensive user study with 72 smart home users to better understand the user\u2019s needs before designing the system and a usability study to evaluate the efficacy of Kratos+ in a real-life smart home environment.",

        "Abstract": "Twitter users signal social identity in their profile descriptions, or bios, in a number of important but complex ways that are not well-captured by existing characterizations of how identity is expressed in language. Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we focus on the problem of learning a Bayesian network over distributed data stored in a commodity cluster. Specifically, we address the challenge of computing the scoring function over distributed data in an efficient and scalable manner, which is a fundamental task during learning. While exact score computation can be done using the MapReduce-style computation, our goal is to compute approximate scores much faster with probabilistic error bounds and in a scalable manner. We propose a novel approach, which is designed to achieve the following: (a) decentralized score computation using the principle of gossiping; (b) lower resource consumption via a probabilistic approach for maintaining scores using the properties of a Markov chain; and (c) effective distribution of tasks during score computation (on large datasets) by synergistically combining well-known hashing techniques. We conduct theoretical analysis of our approach in terms of convergence speed of the statistics required for score computation, and memory and network bandwidth consumption. We also discuss how our approach is capable of efficiently recomputing scores when new data are available. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our approach and compared with the MapReduce-style computation using datasets of different characteristics on a 16-node cluster. When the MapReduce-style computation provided exact statistics for score computation, it was nearly 10 times slower than our approach. Although it ran faster on randomly sampled datasets than on the entire datasets, it performed worse than our approach in terms of accuracy. Our approach achieved high accuracy (below 6% average relative error) in estimating the statistics for approximate score computation on all the tested datasets. In conclusion, it provides a feasible tradeoff between computation time and accuracy for fast approximate score computation on large-scale distributed data.",

        "Abstract": "We do a game-theoretic analysis of leader election, under the assumption that each agent prefers to have some leader than no leader at all. We show that it is possible to obtain a fair Nash equilibrium, where each agent has an equal probability of being elected leader, in a completely connected network, in a bidirectional ring, and a unidirectional ring, in the synchronous setting. In the asynchronous setting, Nash equilibrium is not quite the right solution concept. Rather, we must consider ex post Nash equilibrium; this means that we have a Nash equilibrium no matter what a scheduling adversary does. We show that ex post Nash equilibrium is attainable in the asynchronous setting in all the networks we consider, using a protocol with bounded running time. However, in the asynchronous setting, we require that n > 2. We show that we can get a fair ex post \u03f5-Nash equilibrium if n=2 in the asynchronous setting under some cryptographic assumptions (specifically, the existence of a one-way functions), using a commitment protocol. We then generalize these results to a setting where we can have deviations by a coalition of size k. In this case, we can get what we call a fair k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network if n> 2k; under the same cryptographic assumptions, we can a get a k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network, unidirectional ring, or bidirectional ring if n > k. Finally, we show that under minimal assumptions, not only do our protocols give a Nash equilibrium, they also give a sequential equilibrium, so players even play optimally off the equilibrium path.",

        "Title": "Decentralised Learning in Federated Deployment Environments: A System-Level Survey",
        "Abstract": "Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.",

        "Abstract": "The hardware description language Verilog has been standardized and widely used in industry. Multithreaded Discrete Event Simulation Language (MDESL) is a Verilog-like language and it contains a rich variety of interesting features such as the event-driven computation and shared-variable concurrency as well as the realtime feature. In this paper, we present the denotational semantics for MDESL based on UTP. First a discrete time semantic model is proposed to describe the observation-oriented semantics for MDESL. The observations record the change of variables of atomic actions over time. Then the healthy formulae are defined to denote all different behaviors of programs and the semantics of programs is expressed in terms of healthy formulae. In addition, we demonstrate some interesting properties about the MDESL programs expressing as algebraic laws and their proofs are supported by our formalized denotational semantics. Our theoretical approach is complemented by a practical one, we use the theorem proof assistant Coq to formalize the UTP-based semantics for MDESL. The correctness of the algebraic laws is also verified via the mechanical approach in Coq. Our work provides a novel way to verify the correctness of UTP-based semantics forMDESL both in a theoretical approach and in a practical approach. It is also a new attempt for the application of Coq in the mechanized semantics.",

        "Title": "A Latent Space Modeling Approach to Interfirm Relationship Analysis",
        "Abstract": "Interfirm relationships are crucial to our understanding of firms\u2019 collective and interactive behavior. Many information systems-related phenomena, including the diffusion of innovations, standard alliances, technology collaboration, and outsourcing, involve a multitude of relationships between firms. This study proposes a latent space approach to model temporal change in a dual-view interfirm network. We assume that interfirm relationships depend on an underlying latent space; firms that are close to each other in the latent space are more likely to develop a relationship. We construct the latent space by embedding two dynamic networks of firms in an integrated manner, resulting in a more comprehensive view of an interfirm relationship. We validate our approach by introducing three business measures derived from the latent space model to study alliance formation and stock comovement. We illustrate how the trajectories of firms provide insights into alliance activities. We also show that our proposed measures have strong predictive power on stock comovement. We believe the proposed approach enriches the methodology toolbox of IS researchers in studying interfirm relationships.",

        "Title": "A Hybrid Approach to Formal Verification of Higher-Order Masked Arithmetic Programs",
        "Abstract": "Side-channel attacks, which are capable of breaking secrecy via side-channel information, pose a growing threat to the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Masking is an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks by removing the statistical dependence between secrecy and power consumption via randomization. However, designing efficient and effective masked implementations turns out to be an error-prone task. Current techniques for verifying whether masked programs are secure are limited in their applicability and accuracy, especially when they are applied. To bridge this gap, in this article, we first propose a sound type system, equipped with an efficient type inference algorithm, for verifying masked arithmetic programs against higher-order attacks. We then give novel model-counting-based and pattern-matching-based methods that are able to precisely determine whether the potential leaky observable sets detected by the type system are genuine or simply spurious. We evaluate our approach on various implementations of arithmetic cryptographic programs. The experiments confirm that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of applicability, accuracy, and efficiency.",

        "Title": "Assessing the alignment between the information needs of developers and the documentation of programming languages: A case study on Rust",
        "Abstract": "Programming language documentation refers to the set of technical documents that provide application developers with a description of the high-level concepts of a language (e.g., manuals, tutorials, and API references). Such documentation is essential to support application developers in effectively using a programming language. One of the challenges faced by documenters (i.e., personnel that design and produce documentation for a programming language) is to ensure that documentation has relevant information that aligns with the concrete needs of developers, defined as the missing knowledge that developers acquire via voluntary search. In this paper, we present an automated approach to support documenters in evaluating the differences and similarities between the concrete information need of developers and the current state of documentation (a problem that we refer to as the topical alignment of a programming language documentation). Our approach leverages semi-supervised topic modelling that uses domain knowledge to guide the derivation of topics. We initially train a baseline topic model from a set of Rust-related Q&A posts. We then use this baseline model to determine the distribution of topic probabilities of each document of the official Rust documentation. Afterwards, we assess the similarities and differences between the topics of the Q&A posts and the official documentation. Our results show a relatively high level of topical alignment in Rust documentation. Still, information about specific topics is scarce in both the Q&A websites and the documentation, particularly related topics with programming niches such as network, game, and database development. For other topics (e.g., related topics with language features such as structs, patterns and matchings, and foreign function interface), information is only available on Q&A websites while lacking in the official documentation. Finally, we discuss implications for programming language documenters, particularly how to leverage our approach to prioritize topics that should be added to the documentation.",

        "Title": "Ares: Adaptive, Reconfigurable, Erasure coded, Atomic Storage",
        "Abstract": "Emulating a shared atomic, read/write storage system is a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Replicating atomic objects among a set of data hosts was the norm for traditional implementations (e.g., [11]) in order to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the data despite host failures. As replication is highly storage demanding, recent approaches suggested the use of erasure-codes to offer the same fault-tolerance while optimizing storage usage at the hosts. Initial works focused on a fixed set of data hosts. To guarantee longevity and scalability, a storage service should be able to dynamically mask hosts failures by allowing new hosts to join, and failed host to be removed without service interruptions. This work presents the first erasure-code -based atomic algorithm, called Ares, which allows the set of hosts to be modified in the course of an execution. Ares is composed of three main components: (i) a reconfiguration protocol, (ii) a read/write protocol, and (iii) a set of data access primitives (DAPs). The design of Ares is modular and is such to accommodate the usage of various erasure-code parameters on a per-configuration basis. We provide bounds on the latency of read/write operations and analyze the storage and communication costs of the Ares algorithm.",

Further, IoT systems increasingly demand the resilient operability of services, as they become part of critical infrastructures. This leads to a broad variety of research works that aim to increase the resilience of these systems. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making IoT systems resilient. In particular, we first discuss the taxonomy and classification of resilience and resilience mechanisms and subsequently survey state-of-the-art resilience mechanisms that have been proposed by research work and are applicable to IoT. As part of the survey, we also discuss questions that focus on the practical aspects of resilience, e.g., which constraints resilience mechanisms impose on developers when designing resilient systems by incorporating a specific mechanism into IoT systems.",

        "Title": "Robust Secret Image Sharing Resistant to Noise in Shares",
        "Abstract": "A secret image is split into \n shares in the generation phase of secret image sharing (SIS) for a \nthreshold. In the recovery phase, the secret image is recovered when any \n or more shares are collected, and each collected share is generally assumed to be lossless in conventional SIS during storage and transmission. However, noise will arise during real-world storage and transmission; thus, shares will experience data loss, which will also lead to data loss in the secret image being recovered. Secret image recovery in the case of lossy shares is an important issue that must be addressed in practice, which is the overall subject of this article. An SIS scheme that can recover the secret image from lossy shares is proposed in this article. First, robust SIS and its definition are introduced. Next, a robust SIS scheme for a \nthreshold without pixel expansion is proposed based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and error-correcting codes (ECC). By screening the random numbers, the share generation phase of the proposed robust SIS is designed to implement the error correction capability without increasing the share size. Particularly in the case of collecting noisy shares, our recovery method is to some degree robust to some noise types, such as least significant bit (LSB) noise, JPEG compression, and salt-and-pepper noise. A theoretical proof is presented, and experimental results are examined to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "There is an increasing interest in a fast-growing machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL), in which the model training is distributed over mobile user equipment (UEs), exploiting UEs' local computation and training data. Despite its advantages such as preserving data privacy, FL still has challenges of heterogeneity across UEs' data and physical resources. To address these challenges, we first propose FEDL, a FL algorithm which can handle heterogeneous UE data without further assumptions except strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We provide a convergence rate characterizing the trade-off between local computation rounds of each UE to update its local model and global communication rounds to update the FL global model. We then employ FEDL in wireless networks as a resource allocation optimization problem that captures the trade-off between FEDL convergence wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and power resources. Even though the wireless resource allocation problem of FEDL is non-convex, we exploit this problem's structure to decompose it into three sub-problems and analyze their closed-form solutions as well as insights into problem design. Finally, we empirically evaluate the convergence of FEDL with PyTorch experiments, and provide extensive numerical results for the wireless resource allocation sub-problems. Experimental results show that FEDL outperforms the vanilla FedAvg algorithm in terms of convergence rate and test accuracy in various settings.",

        "Abstract": "The study of autonomous agents has a long history in the Multiagent System and the Semantic Web communities, with applications ranging from automating business processes to personal assistants. More recently, the Web of Things (WoT), which is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) with metadata expressed in Web standards, and its community provide further motivation for pushing the autonomous agents research agenda forward. Although representing and reasoning about norms, policies, and preferences is crucial to ensuring that autonomous agents act in a manner that satisfies stakeholder requirements, normative concepts, policies, and preferences have yet to be considered as first-class abstractions in Web-based multiagent systems. Towards this end, this article motivates the need for alignment and joint research across the Multiagent Systems, Semantic Web, and WoT communities, introduces a conceptual framework for governance of autonomous agents on the Web, and identifies several research challenges and opportunities.",

We introduce a framework that makes this easier by providing a simple interface for tracking realtime energy consumption and carbon emissions, as well as generating standardized online appendices.

However, blackmarket services that allow users to inorganically gain influence are a threat to the credibility of these social networking platforms. Twitter users can gain inorganic appraisals in the form of likes, retweets, and follows through these blackmarket services either by paying for them or by joining syndicates wherein they gain such appraisals by providing similar appraisals to other users. These customers tend to exhibit a mix of organic and inorganic retweeting behavior, making it tougher to detect them.",

        "Title": "Decentralized Asynchronous Crash-resilient Runtime Verification",
        "Abstract": "Runtime verification is a lightweight method for monitoring the formal specification of a system during its execution. It has recently been shown that a given state predicate can be monitored consistently by a set of crash-prone asynchronous distributed monitors observing the system, only if each monitor can emit verdicts taken from a large enough finite set. We revisit this impossibility result in the concrete context of linear-time logic (ltl) semantics for runtime verification, that is, when the correctness of the system is specified by an ltl formula on its execution traces. First, we show that monitors synthesized based on the 4-valued semantics of ltl (rv-ltl) may result in inconsistent distributed monitoring, even for some simple ltl formulas. More generally, given any ltl formula \u03c6, we relate the number of different verdicts required by the monitors for consistently monitoring \u03c6, with a specific structural characteristic of \u03c6 called its alternation number. Specifically, we show that, for every k \u2265 0, there is an ltl formula \u03c6 with alternation number k that cannot be verified at runtime by distributed monitors emitting verdicts from a set of cardinality smaller than k + 1. On the positive side, we define a family of logics, called distributed ltl (abbreviated as dltl), parameterized by k \u2265 0, which refines rv-ltl by incorporating 2k + 4 truth values. Our main contribution is to show that, for every k \u2265 0, every ltl formula \u03c6 with alternation number k can be consistently monitored by distributed monitors, each running an automaton based on a (2 \u2308 k/2 \u2309 +4)-valued logic taken from the dltl family.",

        "Abstract": "Locating the original region of tampered features is a challenging task for existing 2D vector map fragile watermarking methods. This article presents a 2D vector map fragile watermarking framework that locates not only the current but also the original region of tampered feature groups. In particular, we propose dividing the features of the host vector map into groups, and embedding a watermark consisting of location-bits and check-bits into each group at the sender side. At the receiver side, by comparing the extracted and calculated check-bits, one can identify tampered groups and locate their current regions. Then the location-bits extracted from the mapping groups are used to indicate the original regions of the tampered groups. To demonstrate and analyze the applicability of this framework, we instantiate it by proposing a simulated annealing (SA)-based group division method, a group mapping method, a minimum encasing rectangle (MER) based location-bits generation method and a check-bits generation method, and use an existing reversible data hiding method for watermark embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can locate all the regions influenced by tampering, and the SA-based group division method can get a better region location ability.",

The original scheme focused on maximizing single partition (SP) performance, producing results in millions of transactions per second on modest clusters, but at the expense of dismal MP performance. In this paper, we show that original RCST algorithms be made to dramatically improve MP performance with very limited impact on SP performance. That makes RCST superior to popular optimistic and pessimistic schemes without optimizations for batch execution, including OCC and 2PL, on a wide range of multi-node workloads with up to 60% throughput improvement.",

        "Title": "Combining Contract Theory and Lyapunov Optimization for Content Sharing With Edge Caching and Device-to-Device Communications",
        "Abstract": "The paper proposes a novel framework based on the contract theory and Lyapunov optimization for content sharing in a wireless content delivery network (CDN) with edge caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. The network is partitioned into a set of clusters. In a cluster, users can share contents via D2D links in coordination with the cluster head. Upon receiving the content request from any user in its cluster, the cluster head either delivers the content itself or forwards the request to another node, i.e., a base station (BS) or another user in the cluster. The content access at the BS and in each cluster is modeled as a queuing system, where arrivals represent the content requests directed to respective nodes. The objective is to assign content delivery nodes to stabilize all queues while minimizing the time-averaged network cost given incomplete information about content sharing costs of the users and unknown distribution of the network state defined by users' locations and their cached/requested content. The proposed framework allows the users to truthfully reveal their content sharing expenditures, minimize the time-averaged network cost and stabilize the queuing system representing the CDN. Based on this framework, a distributed content access and delivery algorithm where the node assignments are made by every cluster head independently is developed. It is shown that the algorithm converges to the optimal policy with the trade-off in total queue backlog and achieves a superior performance compared with some other D2D content sharing policies.",

        "Title": "Cloud Pricing Models: Taxonomy, Survey, and Interdisciplinary Challenges",
        "Abstract": "This article provides a systematic review of cloud pricing in an interdisciplinary approach. It examines many historical cases of pricing in practice and tracks down multiple roots of pricing in research. The aim is to help both cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud customers to capture the essence of cloud pricing when they need to make a critical decision either to achieve competitive advantages or to manage cloud resource effectively. Currently, the number of available pricing schemes in the cloud market is overwhelming. It is an intricate issue to understand these schemes and associated pricing models clearly due to involving several domains of knowledge, such as cloud technologies, microeconomics, operations research, and value theory. Some earlier studies have introduced this topic unsystematically. Their approaches inevitably lead to much confusion for many cloud decision-makers. To address their weaknesses, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud pricing, which is driven by a framework of three fundamental pricing strategies that are built on nine cloud pricing categories. These categories can be further mapped onto a total of 60 pricing models. Many of the pricing models have been already adopted by CSPs. Others have been widespread across in other industries. We give descriptions of these model categories and highlight both advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, this article offers an extensive survey of many cloud pricing models that were proposed by many researchers during the past decade. Based on the survey, we identify four trends of cloud pricing and the general direction, which is moving from intrinsic value per physical box to extrinsic value per serverless sandbox. We conclude that hyper-converged cloud resources pool supported by cloud orchestration, virtual machine, Open Application Programming Interface, and serverless sandbox will drive the future of cloud pricing.",

This has led to the development of data protection regulations around the globe and the use of sophisticated anonymization techniques to protect privacy. Such measures make it more challenging for the data scientist to understand the data, exacerbating issues of data quality. Responsible data science aims to develop useful insights from the data while fully embracing these considerations.",

        "Title": "Online Aggregation of the Forwarding Information Base: Accounting for Locality and Churn",
        "Abstract": "This paper studies the problem of compressing the forwarding information base FIB, but taking a wider perspective. Indeed, FIB compression goes beyond sheer compression, as the gain in memory use obtained from the compression has consequences on the updates that will have to be applied to the compressed FIB. We are interested in the situation where forwarding rules can change over time, e.g., due to border gateway protocol BGP route updates. Accordingly, we frame FIB compression as an online problem and design competitive online algorithms to solve it. In contrast to prior work which mostly focused on static optimizations, we study an online variant of the problem where routes can change over time and where the number of updates to the FIB is taken into account explicitly. The reason to consider this version of the problem is that leveraging temporal locality while accounting for the number of FIB updates helps to keep routers CPU load low and reduces the number of FIB updates to be transferred, e.g., from the network-attached software-defined network controller to a remote switch. This paper introduces a formal model which is an interesting generalization of several classic online aggregation problems. Our main contribution is an Ow-competitive algorithm, where ${w}$ is the length of an IP address. We also derive a lower bound which shows that our result is asymptotically optimal within a natural class of algorithms, based on so-called sticks.",

However, despite years of research in data governance and management, trustability is still affected by the absence of transparent and traceable data-driven pipelines. In this work, we focus on requirements and challenges that DEs face when ensuring data transparency. Requirements are derived from the data and organizational management, as well as from broader legal and ethical considerations. We propose a novel knowledge-driven DE architecture, providing the pillars for satisfying the analyzed requirements. We illustrate the potential of our proposal in a real-world scenario. Last, we discuss and rate the potential of the proposed architecture in the fulfillmentof these requirements.",

Specifically, we list and review the different protection approaches that have been proposed to ensure user and data security and privacy in MR. We extend the scope to include work on related technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction as crucial components, if not the origins, of MR, as well as numerous related work from the larger area of mobile devices, wearables, and Internet-of-Things. We highlight the lack of investigation, implementation, and evaluation of data protection approaches in MR. Further challenges and directions on MR security and privacy are also discussed.",
